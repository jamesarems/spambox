    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
"
Read all positions in this section carefully (multiple times is recommended!!!)!&nbsp;A wrong configuration sequence or wrong configuration values can lead in to a destroyed ASSP configuration!
  If set, the configuration value and option files synchronization will be enabled. This synchronization belong to the configuration values, to the file that is possibly defined in a value and to the include files that are possibly defined in the configured file. If you don't want a specific configuration file or include file to be synchronized (send and receive), write
  # assp-no-sync
  as a comment anywhere in the file. An possible reason could be for example 'localDomains' - if ASSP1 is hosting DOMAIN1 and DOMAIN2 but ASSP2 is hosting only DOMAIN2 - so the entry for DOMAIN2 could be put in a not synchronized include file on ASSP1 and the synchronized main config file contains the entry for DOMAIN1.
  If the configuration of all values in this section is valid, the synchronization status will be shown in the GUI for each config value that is, or could be shared. There are several configuration values, that could not be shared. The list of all shareable values could be found in the distributed file assp_sync.cfg
  For an initial synchronization setup set the following config values in this order: setup syncServer, syncConfigFile, syncTestMode and as last syncCFGPass (leave isShareSlave and isShareMaster off). Use the default (distributed syncConfigFile assp_sync.cfg) file and configure all values to your needs - do this on all peers by removing lines or setting the general sync flag to 0 or 1 (see the description of syncConfigFile ).
  If you have finished this initial setup, enable isShareMaster or isShareSlave - now assp will setup all entries in the configuration file for all sync peers to the configured default values (to 1 if isShareMaster or to 3 if isShareSlave is selected). Do this on all peers. Now you can configure the synchronization behavior for each single configuration value for each peer, if it should differ from the default setup.
  For the initial synchronization, configure only one ASSP installation as master (all others as slave). If the initial synchronization has finished, which will take up to one hour, you can configure all or some assp as master and slave. On the initial master simply switch on isShareSlave. On the inital slaves, switch on isShareMaster and change all values in the sync config file that should be bidirectional shared from 3 to 1. As last action enable enableCFGShare on the SyncSlaves first and then on the SyncMaster.
  After such an initial setup, any changes of the peers (syncServer) will have no effect to the configuration file (syncConfigFile)! To add or remove a sync peer after an initial setup, you have to configure syncServer and you have to edit the sync config file manualy.
  This option can only be enabled, if isShareMaster and/or isShareSlave and syncServer and syncConfigFile and syncCFGPass are configured!
  Because the synchronization is done using a special SMTP protocol (without 'mail from' and 'rcpt to'), this option requires an installed  module in PERL. If you want the sync feature to use a secured connection (using STARTTLS) , DoTLS has to be set to 'do TLS'. This special SMTP protocol is not usable to for any MTA for security reasons, so the 'sync mails' could not be forwarded via any MTA.
  For this reason all sync peers must have a direct or routed TCP connection to each other peer.
  If you build a sync topology with more than two ASSP, please notice, that it is not allowed to build any ring-synchronization. Only a chain-, tree- or star- topology is supported. It is also not allowed to build a sync ring inside any of the three allowed topologies!

The syncflag is a general sign, which means, a value of 0 disables the synchronization of the config value for all peers. A value of 1, enables the peer configuration that possibly follows.
 The format after an initial setup is: 'varname:=syncflag,syncServer1=status,syncServer2=status,......'. The 'status' could be one of the following:
 0 - no sync - changes of this value will not be sent to this syncServer - I will ignore all change requests for this value from there
 1 - I am a SyncMaster, the value is still out of sync to this peer and should be synchronized as soon as possible
 2 - I am a SyncMaster, the value is still in sync to this peer - I am also a SyncSlave to this peer (bidirectional sync) if isShareSlave is enabled
 3 - I am not a SyncMaster but a SyncSlave - only this SyncMaster (peer) knows the current sync status to me
 4 - I am a SyncMaster and a SyncSlave (bidirectional sync) - a change of this value was still received from this syncServer (peer) and should not be sent back to this syncServer - this flag will be automaticaly set back to 2 at the next synchronization check

"
For IPv6 network support to be enabled, check this box. Default is disabled. IO::Socket::INET6 is able to handle both IPv4 and IPv6. NOTE: This option requires an installed  module in PERL and your system should support IPv6 sockets to give enableing this option a sense!
  It is recommended to leave this option OFF as long as you don't want to use IPv6 addresses for a listener or a destination (SMTP,DNS-server,LDAP-server etc.).
  Before you enable or disable IPv6, please check every IP listener and destination definition in assp and correct the settings. After changing this option a restart of assp is recommended. IPv4 addresses are defined for example 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.0.1:25 - IPv6 addresses are defined like [FE80:1:0:0:0:0:0:1]:25 or [FE80:1::1]:25 ! If an IPv4 address is defined for a listener, assp will listen only on the IPv4 socket. If an IPv6 address is defined for a listener, assp will listen only on the IPv6 socket. If only a port is defined for a listener, assp will listen on both IPv4 and IPv6 sockets.
  For the definition of destination IP's applies the same. You are free to define hostnames instead of IP addresses like myhost.mydomain.com:25 - how ever, because of the needed IP address resolving, this will possibly slow down assp.

    DESCRIPTION
"

 If you don't want to use group definitions, leave this field blank otherwise a file definition like 'file:files/groups.txt' is required.
 Group definitions could be used in any other configuration value where multiple user names, email addresses or domain names or IP addresses could be defined.
 Groups are defined and used using the same syntax [group-name] (including the brackets) in a single line. In the configuration parameters, the line [group-name] will be replaced by the content of the group definition, that is done here.
 All group definitions are case sensitive. Group names can only contain the following characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, - , _ and @ !
 The structure of this file has to be as follows:
 
 [super_spamlovers]
 myBoss
 ldap:{host=&gt;my_LDAP_server:389,base=&gt;(sep)DC=domain,DC=tld(sep),user=&gt;(sep)CN=admin,DC=domain(sep),password=&gt;(sep)pass(sep),timeout=&gt;2,scheme=&gt;ldap,STARTTLS=&gt;1,version=&gt;3},{(CN=management)}{member},{(CN=%USERID%)}{mailaddress}
 entry
 exec:/usr/bin/list_postfix_users --domain mydomain --group postoffice
 entry
 ...
 
 [admins]
 ldap:{host=&gt;domino1.mydomain.com:389,base=&gt;(sep)DC=domain,DC=tld(sep),user=&gt;(sep)Administrator(sep),password=&gt;(sep)pass(sep),timeout=&gt;2,scheme=&gt;ldap,STARTTLS=&gt;1,version=&gt;3},{(CN=LocalDomainAdmins)}{member},{(CN=%USERID%)}{mailaddress}
 entry
 entry
 ...
 
 [specialIPList]
 1.2.3.4
 123.234.0.0/16
 ::1
 
 Lines starting with a # OR ; are consider a comment. Empty lines will be ignored. An group definition stopps, if a new group definition starts or at the end of the file. Comments are not allowed inside a definition line.
 
 There are two possible methods to import entries from an external source in to a group - the execution of a system command or a LDAP query.
 To import entries via a system command like (eg. cat|grep or find or your self made shell script), write a single line that begins with exec: followed by the command to be executed - like:
 exec:cat /etc/anydir/*.txt|grep '@'
 The executed system command has to write a comma(,) or pipe(|) or linefeed(LF,CRLF) separated list of entries to STDOUT, that should become part of that group, where this line is used. There could be multiple and any combination of entry types in one group definition.
 
 If you are familar with the usage of LDAP, you can define LDAP querys to import entries from one or more LDAP server. This is done, defining one query per line. The syntax of such a line is:
 
 ldap:{host_and_protocol},{LDAP_group_query_filter}{LDAP_group_query_attribut_to_return},{LDAP_entry_query_filter}{LDAP_entry_query_attribut_to_return}
 
 If the 'host_and_protocol' part is empty {}, the default LDAP configuration will be used. An 'host_and_protocol' part should contain the following entries in the following structure:
 {host=&gt;127.0.0.1:389,base=&gt;(sep)DC=domain,DC=tld(sep),user=&gt;(sep)...(sep),password=&gt;(sep)pass(sep),timeout=&gt;..,scheme=&gt;ldap/ldaps,STARTTLS=&gt;0/1,version=&gt;2/3}
 The 'host' has to be set, if you want to define any other LDAP parameter. If any other parameter is not defined, the default LDAP configuration value will be used, except user and password. The port definition (:xxx) in the host setting is optional - if not defined, the default LDAP ports 389(LDAP) and 636(LDAPS) will be used. It is possible to define a comma(,) separated list of hosts for failover functionality like 'host=>'localhost:389,192.168.1.1:389,....'' - notice the quotes as terminator which are required in this case!
 The value of the base, password and user parameter has to start and end with a single character (sep) as terminator, that is not part of the value
 and is not used in the value. The parameter 'base' defines the LDAP search root like LDAPRoot .
 
 The 'LDAP_group_query_filter' and 'LDAP_group_query_attribut_to_return' are used to query a LDAP group for it's members (users). The resulting list will contain the requested attributes of all group members. The definition of these two parameters could look as follows:
 {(&(objectclass=dominoGroup)(CN=LocalDomainAdmins))}{member}
 
 It is possible to modify each returned value with a callback-code. This is for example usefull for MS-AD querys on the attribute 'proxyaddresses', which returns a list of all available mail addresses (SMTP,smtp,X400...).
 
 example: ldap:{},{(&(CN=firstname lastname)(proxyaddresses=smtp:*))<=s/^\s*smtp:\s*(.+)\s*$/$1/i}{proxyaddresses},{}{}
 
 <= is the required separator, s/^\s*smtp:\s*(.+)\s*$/$1/i is the callback code.
 The callback code has to return a value of not zero or undef on success. The code gets the LDAP result in the variable $_ and has to modify this variable in place on success.
 It is not allowed to use any of the following characters in the callback definiton of a ldap line: {}| 
 
 The 'LDAP_entry_query_filter' and 'LDAP_entry_query_attribut_to_return' are used to query each member from the first query, for it's email address. The literal '%USERID%' in the 'LDAP_entry_query_filter' will be replaced by each LDAP-attribute result of the first query. The definition of these two parameters could look as follows:
 {(&(objecttype=person)(CN=%USERID%)(o=%USERID%))}{mailaddress}
 or more simple
 {(&(objecttype=person)(CN=%USERID%))}{mailaddress}
 
 An callback code could be used the same way like for 'LDAP_group_query_filter' - {(&(objecttype=person)(CN=%USERID%))<=callback-code}{mailaddress}.
 
 To break long lines in to multiple, terminate a continued line with a slash '/'
 If you are able to get all results (eg. email addresses or domain names) with the 'LDAP_group_query' query, leave the definition of 'LDAP_entry_query_filter' and 'LDAP_entry_query_attribut_to_return' empty {}{}.
 
 The result of each group definition will be stored in a file in files/group_export/GROUPNAME.txt.
 The groups are build at every start of assp and if the defined file or an include file is stored (changed file time). To force a reload of all groups, open the file and click 'Save changes' or change the file time with an external shell script. It is also possible to use GroupsReloadEvery, to reload the Groups definition in time intervals, if the exec: or ldap: option are used.

    DESCRIPTION
"
If an email matches this Perl regular expression it will be considered redlisted.
 redRe detects tags to process a mail like the recipient were redlisted - nothing else (no redlist addition/removal).
 The Redlist serves two purposes:
1) the Redlist is a list of addresses that cannot contribute to the
whitelist and which are not considered local even if their mail is
from a local computer. For example, if someone goes on a vacation and
turns on their autoresponder, put them on the redlist until
they return. Then as they reply to every spam they receive they won't
corrupt your non-spam collection or whitelist: \[autoreply\]
2) Redlisted addresses will not be added to the Whitelist when your
local user sends mail to that address, thereby preventing accidental
pollution of the Whitelist by, say, inadvertent replies by your
users to mails from the spammer.
Redlisted messages will not be stored in the SPAM/NOTSPAM-collection. As all fields marked by * this field accepts
a list separated by | or a specified file 'file:files/redre.txt'.

 Randomly picked up bit sequences of the text defined here, are used as 'SALT' to calculate a 10 digit not-spam-tag. This value must be at least 12 characters long. Leave this value empty to disable this feature.
 To define your own static TAGs, use whiteRe and/or npRe and change the error reply definitions accordingly.
 To generate a random 80 character string, run 'perl -e 'print chr(int(rand(94))+33)for(0...79);'' from command line and copy and paste the result to here.

 delaySpamLovers are not included here and must be set additionally.
 Accepts specific addresses (user@domain.com), user parts (user) or entire domains (@domain.com). Wildcards are supported (fribo*@domain.com). Default: postmaster|abuse.For example: fribo*@thisdomain.com|jhanna|@sillyguys.org
 
 This option and all SpamLover-Options (...SpamLovers) below accepting a second score parameter like 'user@your-domain.com=>70'
 If such a parameter is defined in any option for an entry and the recipient address matches this entry and the message score exceeds the parameter value, the message will be considered spam.
 If there are multiple possible matches for a recipient address found, the generic longest match (and assigned value) will be used.
 ASSP will use the highest found value for all envelope recipients of an email.
 The according low limit is calculated as:
 for outgoing mails: value - ( PenaltyMessageLimit - PenaltyMessageLow )
 or
 for incoming and local mails: value - ( LocalPenaltyMessageLimit - LocalPenaltyMessageLow )

  It is possible to define a predefined group on any or both sides of the '=>' separator, like:
  [ipgroup]=>[usergroup]|user@mydomain
  NOTICE: the following combination of two entries, will lead in to a user/domain based matching - the global entry will be ignored!

Domains and addresses from which you want to receive all mail. Your ISP, domain registration, mail list servers, stock broker, or other key business partners might be good candidates. Be careful not to put widely used or local domains here like google.com or hotmail.com or mydomain.com. Note this matches the end of the address, so if you don't want to match subdomains then include the @. Note that example.com would also match spamexample.com but .example.com won't match example.com. Wildcards are supported. For example: sourceforge.net|group*@google.com|.example.com
  It is possible to make email addresses whitelisted only for a set of local domains and/or local users. Use wildcards (* and ?) to define domains.
  Use the following syntax to do this:
  *@anydomain=>*@any_local_domain - for domain to domain
  *@*.anydomain=>*@any_local_domain - for any sub-domain to domain
  user@anydomain=>*@*.any_local_domain - for user to any sub-domain
  It is possible to define more than one entry at the left and the right side of the definition (=&gt;), like:
  *@anydomain|*@other_domain=>*@any_local_domain|*@other_local_domain - always separate multiple entries by pipes
  It is also possible to use a GroupDefinition in any or both sides, like:
  [sendergroup]=>[recipientgroup]
  [sendergroup1]|[sendergroup2]|*@domain=>[recipientgroup1]|[recipientgroup2]|user@local_domain

Check local domains against these addresses. Add a fake domain like 'assp-nospam.org' for the email interface if you run MS Exchange. When mailing to eg. 'spam@assp-nospam.org' MS Exchange forwards it outbound to ASSP who handles the different options. As in every field marked by '*' separate addresses with | or use file 'file:files/localdomains.txt'. Wildcards are supported. For example: *mydomain.com|*.mydomain.com|here.org 
 Use the syntax: *mydomain.com=>smtp.mydomain.com|other.com=>mx.other.com:port|other2.com=>mx.other.com:port,mx2.other.com:port to verify the recipient addresses with the SMTP-VRFY (if VRFY is not supported 'MAIL FROM:' and 'RCPT TO:' will be used) command on other SMTP servers. The entry behind => must be the hostname:port or ip-address:port of the MTA which is used to verify 'RCPT TO' addresses with a VRFY command! If :port is not defined, port :25 will be used. You can use an entry like ALL=>vrfyhost:port to define a VRFY host for all local domain entries that don't have a MTA defined ( better use Groups ). Separate multiple VRFY hosts for failover by comma ','. You have to enable the SMTP 'VRFY' command on your MTA - the 'EXPN' command should be enabled! This requires an installed  module in PERL. 
 If you have configured LDAP and enabled DoLDAP and ASSP finds a VRFY entry for a domain, LDAP search will be done first and if this fails, the VRFY will be used. So VRFY could be used for LDAP backup/fallback/failover!
 It is recommended to configure 'ldaplistdb' in the 'File Paths and Database' section when using this verify extension - so ASSP will store all verified recipients addresses there to minimize the querys on MTA's. There is no need to configure LDAP, but both VRFY and LDAP are using ldaplistdb. Please go to the 'LDAP setup' section to configure MaxLDAPlistDays and LDAPcrossCheckInterval or start a crosscheck now with forceLDAPcrossCheck. This three parameters belong also to VRFY.

Addresses  &amp; Domains from which you always want to reject mail, they only send you spam. Note this matches the end of the address, so if you don't want to match subdomains then include the @. Note that buy.com would also match spambuy.com but .buy.com won't match buy.com. abc@def.com will match abc@def.com but won't match bbc@def.com. Wildcards are supported. For example: cc|info|biz|seller@bayer.com|sell*@basf.com
  It is possible to make email addresses blacklisted only for a set of local domains and/or local users. Use wildcards (* and ?) to define domains.
  Use the following syntax to do this:
  *@anydomain=>*@any_local_domain - for domain to domain
  *@*.anydomain=>*@any_local_domain - for any sub-domain to domain
  user@anydomain=>*@*.any_local_domain - for user to any sub-domain
  It is possible to define more than one entry at the left and the right side of the definition (=&gt;), like:
  *@anydomain|*@other_domain=>*@any_local_domain|*@other_local_domain - always separate multiple entries by pipes
  It is also possible to use a GroupDefinition in any or both sides, like:
  [sendergroup]=>[recipientgroup]
  [sendergroup1]|[sendergroup2]|*@domain=>[recipientgroup1]|[recipientgroup2]|user@local_domain
  NOTICE - that the local email addresses and domains are not checked to be local once

  The next mail from a domain that is found in this cache, must have a DKIM-Signature to pass the DKIM-pre-check. How ever, some DNS records are wrong or inaccurate and will cause ASSP to block mails because of this - register such domains and/or IP's in noDKIMAddresses and/or noDKIMIP .

If DoPenalty and DoPenaltyMessage are set not to disabled and DoDamping is not set to 0, ASSP will slowdown the spammers traffic speed proportional to the current message score - because slowing down their speed will reduce spam everywhere.
  The delay in seconds per receive/read cycle is calculated by the division [messagescore / DoDamping] . A recommended value is 5 default is 0. In this case the delay for a message score of 50 would be 10 seconds.
  Do not use this option, if you have a highly frequented system, because the spammers connections will stay possibly a long time on your system, and you system could possibly reach the sessions limit ( maxSMTPSessions ).
  Damping is never done for: noprocessing, whitelisted, nodelay, ISP, redlisted, noPB, outgoing/releayed and contentonly addresses, IP's, messages.
  Damping may not be done for forced checks, relay attemps, messages reaching maxerrors, spamtrapaddresses and if any block condition is found - because ASSP will no more read from those connections and closes such connections immediately - but ASSP will try to keep the connection open for the calculated time, before it closes the connection.
  Using this option or using a too low value (long delay) could possibly prevent ASSP from receiving spam messages, for example for spamlovers or sendAllSpam . Some Servers could give up sending data, because of too long delays.

RBLServiceProvider  OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING
    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
"
Names of DNSBLs to use separated by '|'. You may set for every provider a weight like zen.spamhaus.org=>50|bl.spamcop.net=>25.
 Defaults are:
 zen.spamhaus.org=>1|bl.spamcop.net=>1|psbl.surriel.com=>2|ix.dnsbl.manitu.net=>2|
 l2.apews.org=>3|combined.njabl.org=>1|safe.dnsbl.sorbs.net=>1|dnsbl-1.uceprotect.net=>2|
 dnsbl-2.uceprotect.net=>2|dnsbl-3.uceprotect.net=>2|blackholes.five-ten-sg.com=>3'.
 DNSBL providers can get a 'weight' like bl.spamcop.net=>1.
 The value of the weight can be set directly like=>45 or as a divisor of RBLmaxweight. Low numbers &lt; 6 are divisors . So if RBLmaxweight = 50 (default) bl.spamcop.net=>50  would be the same as bl.spamcop.net=>1, bl.spamcop.net=>2 would be the same as bl.spamcop.net=>25.
 If the sum of weights surpasses RBLmaxweight, the DNSBL check fails.  If not, the DNSBL check is scored as 'neutral' even with RBLmaxhits reached. Setting Showmaxreplies will allow ALL replies to contribute to the total weight regardless of RBLmaxhits.
 Some RBL Service Providers, like blackholes.five-ten-sg.com, provides different return codes in a single DNS-zone: like 127.a.b.c - where a,b,c are used to identify a weight or type (or what ever) of the returned entry. If you want to care about special return codes, or if you want to use different weights for different return codes, you should use the following enhanced entry syntax:
 RBL-Service-Provider=>result-to-watch=>weight (like:)
 blackholes.five-ten-sg.com=>127.0.0.2=>3
 blackholes.five-ten-sg.com=>127.0.0.5=>4
 blackholes.five-ten-sg.com=>127.0.?.*=>5
 You can see, the wildcards * (multiple character) and ? (single character) are possible to use in the second parameter. Never mix the three possible syntax types for the same RBL Service Provider. An search for a match inside such a definition is done in reverse ASCII order, so the wildcards are used as last.
 Some RBL Service Providers, provides different return codes using a bitmask in any part of the reply. To define weights for bitmasks, place a single 'M' in front of the mask number, like
 sp.com=>127.0.0.M2=>25
 sp.com=>127.0.0.M4=>41
 sp.com=>127.0.M1.5=>56
 sp.com=>127.0.M64.*=>11
 sp.com=>127.0.0.2=>22
 sp.com=>127.0.*.*=>1
 Valid bitmasks are 1,2,4,8,16,32,64 and 128. The resulting weight will be the weight sum of all matching bitmasks (if no full qualified definition is found). For example: a return code of 127.0.0.6 for sp.com will result in a weight of 66 (25+41), a reply of 127.0.0.2 will result in 22
 Because each single bitmask indicates a set of 128 numbers you should prevent the usage of something like 127.0.M16.M1 - this will lead in to a set of (128*128) 16384 addresses, which is really too much!
 For the same service provider, first define all bitmask definitions, after that all full qualified definitions and than all definitions with wildcards, like in the example above! If your definition order is wrong, the resulting weights will be unexpected!

UserAttach  OBJECT-TYPE

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
"
This set of regular expression is used to identify attachments that should be allowed or blocked for specified users and/or domains. Separate entries with a any of '=&gt; , ; space'. Separate multiple regex entries with pipe '|'. The dot . is assumed to precede the regex, so don't include it anywhere (except the user name).
  To define entries you have to use the 'file:...' option. Define one entry per line - comments are not allowed in a definition line.
  The syntax of an entry is as follows:
  username => good => goodAttachRegex , good-out => goodoutRegex , good-in => goodinRegex , block => blockAttachRegex , block-out => blockoutRegex , block-in => blockinRegex
  username - Mail solely to or from any of these addresses. Accepts specific addresses (user@domain.com), user parts (user) or entire domains (@domain.com) or a Group definition [GROUP]. Wildcards are supported (fribo*@domain.com).
  good => goodAttachRegex - good attachment for incoming and outgoing mails
  good-out => goodoutRegex - good attachment for outgoing mails
  good-in => goodinRegex - good attachment for incoming mails
  block => blockAttachRegex - bad attachment for incoming and outgoing mails
  block-out => blockoutRegex - bad attachment for outgoing mails
  block-in => blockinRegex - bad attachment for incoming mails
  For example:
  user@domain.tld => good => ai|asc|bhx|dat|doc|eps|gif|htm|html|ics|jpg|jpeg|hqx|od[tsp]|pdf|ppt|rar|rpt|rtf|snp|txt|xls|zip
  *@domain.tld => good => ai|asc|bhx , good-out => eps|gif , good-in => htm|html , block => pdf|ppt , block-out => rar|rpt , block-in => xls|exe\-bin
  At least one of the above option must be defined in a line - a maximum of all (six) could be defined, if this makes sense.
  If the user name matches for a sender or recipient and a (in/out) regex definition is found in this file, all level definition are overwritten for this mail.
  good, good-out and good-in - and also - block, block-out and block-in - will be logical OR combined according to the mail flow.
  Notice: if a bad attachment is found on a user based attachment check, the penalty box IP address scoring is skipped.

"
If a ClamAV or FileScan result matches this expression it will be scored with the suspicious virus score ( vsValencePB ) and the message will not be blocked.
 It is possible to weight such results. Every weighted regex that contains at least one '|' has to begin and end with a '~' - inside such regexes it is not allowed to use a '~', even it is escaped - for example:  ~abc\~|def~=>23 or ~abc~|def~=>23 - instead use the octal (\126) or hex (\x7E) notation , for example ~abc\126|def~=>23 or ~abc\x7E|def~=>23 . Every weighted regex has to be followed by '=>' and the weight value. For example: Phishing\.=>1.45|~Heuristics|Email~=>50  or ~(Email|HTML|Sanesecurity)\.(Phishing|Spear|(Spam|Scam)[a-z0-9]?)\.~=>4.6|Spam=>1.1|~Spear|Scam~=>2.1 . The multiplication result of the weight and the penaltybox valence value will be used for scoring, if the absolute value of weight is less or equal 6. Otherwise the value of weight is used for scoring.

ASSP will call this system command and expects a returned string from this command. This returned string is checked against 'FileScanBad' and/or 'FileScanGood' to detect if the message is OK or not! If the file does not exists after the command call, the message is consider infected. ASSP expects, that the file scan is finished when the command returns!
  The literal 'FILENAME' will be replaced by the full qualified file name of the temporary file.
  The literal 'NUMBER' will be replaced by the threadnumber and could be used to name logfiles and to redirect them to STDOUT.
  The literal 'FILESCANDIR' will be replaced with the value of FileScanDir.
  Any case sensitive literal starting and ending with an asterix (*) like '*rcpt*' or '*mailfrom*' will be replaced by the quoted runtime connection variable of Con{fh}->{literal} (this->{literal}). You need to know the assp internals!
  If a code reference is defined for the internal variable &#36;main::FileScanCMDbuild_API in lib/CorrectASSPcfg.pm , assp will call '&#36;FileScanCMDbuild_API->(\&#36;cmd,&#36;this)' before running the command. The first parameter, the command (FileScanCMD), is submitted as a reference to a scalar, which must be modified in place. If you want assp not to scan the message, set this variable to undef. The second submitted parameter is the reference to the client connection parameter HASH - &#36;Con{fh} (eg. &#36;this)
  All outputs of this command to STDERR are automatic redirected to STDOUT.
  FileScan will not run, if FileScanCMD is not specified.
  If you have your online/autoprotect file scanner configured to delete infected files inside the 'FileScanDir', define 'NORUN' in this field! In this case FileScanGood and FileScanBad are ignored. If there is a need to wait some time for the autoprotect scanner, write 'NORUN-dddd', where dddd are the milliseconds to wait!
  Depending on your operating system it may possible, that you have to quote (' or ') the command, if it contains whitespaces. The replaced file name will be quoted by ASSP if needed.

This needs a fully functional HMMdb database built by rebuildspamdb. For starters it is best practice to put this in monitoring mode and build the HMM collection with the help of DSNBL ,URIBL and spamaddresses. Scoring is done with HMMValencePB for external mails, HMMlocalValencePB is used for outgoing and internal mails - both values are multiplied with the detected hmmProbability. It is possible to score (in and out) with a bonus for HAM with HMMhamValencePB ( HMMhamValencePB * ( 1 - baysProbability )).
  The perl module  version 0.34 or higher and BerkeleyDB version 4.5 or higher is required (to store temporary data) to use this feature and 'useBerkeleyDB' must be set to ON.
  If this option is disabled, the rebuildspamdb task will NOT build a valid HMM database!
  Compared to the Bayesian option, the Hidden Markov Model will produce results that are much more exact. How ever, it is possible, that HMM gets no result on very small messages, for this reason it is recommended to use both Bayesian and HMM. If you enable both checks, check your settings for baysValencePB, HMMValencePB, bayslocalValencePB and HMMlocalValencePB - eg. divide them by 2. or set the bayes values to 1/3 and the HMM values to 2/3.
  NOTICE that using this option requires a very fast database server behind, if HMMusesBDB is set to OFF. The Bayesian- and HMM check together can produce 4000 and much more SQL querys per second.
  Keep in mind, that all backups and exports of the HMM database could require several 100MB of diskspace, if the file count in the corpus is very large.

    DESCRIPTION
"
 Spam-Mails having a confidence below this threshold are passed in TestMode .
 Spam-Mails having a confidence above this threshold are blocked. Set this only above 0 if you are familiar with the bayesian statistics used in ASSP.
 Messages that are processed by the bayesian and HMM check get a spam-probability score and a confidence score. The confidence score in assp is a quality indicator. A confidence near 0 would mean the probability score is like a wild guess. A confidence score near 1 would mean that it's pretty sure that the bayesian analysis result is correct. The confidence threshold is an allowance to process a Bayesian/HMM Spam as-if in Bayesian TestMode, if the message's *confidence* score is lower than the confidence threshold.
 Set this level to a specfic value, let's say .001 (which is a good one for starting), then:
 - messages with spam-probability higher than 0.6 and a confidence of less than 0.001 would come through as in test mode
 - messages with spam-probability higher than 0.6 and a confidence of more than 0.001 would be blocked
 - messages with spam-probability less than 0.6 would pass
 The 0.6 threshold can be set in baysProbability .
 Carefully set this parameter above 0, if the bayesian corpus norm (shown by the rebuildspamdb log) is less than 0.6 or higher than 1.4 .
 The following math is used to calculate the SpamProbConfidence value for 'n' found Bayesian-Word-Pairs or HMM-Sequences, each with a spam-weight 'p' - where 0&lt;p&lt;1 :
 extreme_confidence_count = |(0 &lt; p<sub>1...n</sub> &lt; 0.01)| - |(0.99 &lt; p<sub>1...n</sub> &lt; 1)|
 extreme_confidence_count = 0 - if ( extreme_confidence_count &lt; 0 and SpamProb &gt; 0.5) or ( extreme_confidence_count &gt; 0 and SpamProb &lt;= 0.5) == TRUE; 
 extreme_confidence_count = abs( extreme_confidence_count )
 mail_confidence = abs((P<sub>1</sub> * P<sub>2</sub> * ... * P<sub>k</sub>) - ((1 - P<sub>1</sub>) * (1 - P<sub>2</sub> ) * ... * (1 - P<sub>k</sub>))) - for all elements P<sub>1...k</sub> in (0.01 &lt; p<sub>1...n</sub> &lt; 0.99)
 corpus_confidence = 1 / ((abs(1 - corpus_norm) + 1)<sup>int(abs(1 - corpus_norm) * 10)</sup>) - the exponent is limited to a maximum of 4
 SpamProbConfidence = 0.01<sup>extreme_confidence_count</sup> * mail_confidence * corpus_confidence * (n / maxBayesValues)<sup>2</sup>
 The SpamProbConfidence is limited to a maximum of 1.0 . 
 All extreme values 'p' having a spam weight less than 0.01 or higher than 0.99 with a corresponding extreme value like (0.009 &lt;-&gt; 0.999) are ignored for the mail_confidence calculation.

Checked means that you want ASSP to intercept and parse mail to the following usernames at any localdomains. The domain '@assp.local' is automatically a local domain and can be used for the email-interface.
  
  NOTICE: It is possible to define any MIME-header lines in any report file after the first (subject) line. This makes it possible to define MIME encoding and/or charset settings.
  If a definition of MIME encoding and/or charset is found in a report file, assp converts the report from UTF-8 in to the defined encodings.  Don't forget to terminate your MIME-header with an empty line!
  It is also possible to include files at any line of such a file, using the following directive
  # include filename
  where filename is the relative path (from C:/assp) to the included file like reports/mime-header.txt (one file per line). The line will be internaly replaced by the contents of the included file!

To use this multi-attachment-feature an installed  module in PERL is needed. It is also possible to send MS-outlook '.msg' files (possibly zipped). To use this MS-outlook-feature in addition an installed  module in PERL is needed.

"
The database driver used to access your database - DBD-driver. The following drivers are available on your system:
  $DBdriversJ
  If you can not find the driver for your database in this list, you should install it via cpan or ppm!
  -  or if you have installed an ODBC-driver for your database and DBD-ODBC, just create a DSN and use ODBC.
  If assp is running on windows and you want to use a MSSQL server as backend, don't use the ODBC driver - use the ADO driver with the DSN definition!
  Useful are ADO|DB2|Informix|ODBC|Oracle|Pg|Sybase|mysql - but any other SQL compatible database should also work.
  syntax examples: driver,option1,option2,...,...
  ADO[,DSN=mydsn[;Provider=sqloledb]]
  DB2
  Informix
  ODBC,DSN=mydsn|driver=\{SQL Server\},Server=server_name
  Oracle,SID=1|INSTANCE_NAME=myinstance|SERVER=myserver|SERVICE_NAME=myservice_name,[PORT=myport]
  Pg[,PORT=myport]
  Sybase,SERVER=myserver,[PORT=myport]
  mysql[,PORT=myport][,mysql_socket=/path/to/mysql.sock][,AutoCommit=1][,mysql_auto_reconnect=1]
  Instead using local files for hashes and lists via shared memory, it is recommended to use  (Perl-module) version 0.34 or higher for highest performance and less memory usage.  The BerkeleyDB (engine) version 4.5 or higher is required to use BerkeleyDB.
  If you specify BerkeleyDB here, the values for myhost, mydb, myuser and mypassword will be ignored. All possible BerkeleyDB option must be defined here - the option for '-Filename' is already set by ASSP! Options could be defined for example:
  BerkeleyDB,-Pagesize=>number,-Env=>[-Cachesize=>number,-Mode=>mode,...,...],...,...
  If '-Env=>[-Cachesize=>number]' (number in bytes) is specified, this cache size will be used at minimum for every single list. This is not recommended, because ASSP does automaticly calculate the right cache for every list. You may setup configuration values for any BerkeleyDB, creating a file  (case sensitive) in the corresponding directory ./tmpDB/[list]. Please use the BerkeleyDB documentation if you don't know the syntax of this file. Any value defined in that file will overwrite the corresponding internal ASSP configuration for this DB.
  The options for all drivers and their possible or required order depends on the DBD driver used, please read the driver's documentation, if you do not know the needed option.
  The username, password, host and databasename are always used from this configuration page.

  If the ASSP_ARC plugin is used, the file will be deleted from the collection after it was archived. This is the only 'no collect' option which removes an already collected file, all other options will prevent assp from creating a collection file - if set to 'no collection'. The check is limited to MaxBytes or at max 100000 Bytes.

Regular Expression to identify loglines for which a notification message should be send.
  useful entries are:
  Info: new assp version - to get informed about new available assp versions
  info: autoupdate: new assp version - to get informed about an autoupdate of the running script
  adminupdate: - for config changes
  admininfo: - for admin information
  option list file: - for option file reload
  error: - for any error
  warning: - for any warning
  restart - to detect a ASSP restart
  notification: too many recipients - for local frequency abuse once per day and sender
  warning: too many recipients - for every local frequency abuse
  MainThread started - to detect a start of ASSP
  Admin connection - for GUI logon
  You may define a comma separated list (after '=>') of recipients in every line, this will override the default recipient defined in 'Notify'.
  for example: adminupdate:=>user1@yourdomain.com,user2@yourdomain.com.
  NOTICE: that groups are not allowed to be used for the second parameter!
  As third parameter after a second ('=>') you can define the subject line for the notification message.
  for example: adminupdate:=>user1@yourdomain.com,user2@yourdomain.com=>configuration was changed
  or: adminupdate:=>=>configuration was changed.

ReStartSchedule  OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING
    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
"
If not set to 'noschedule' (noschedule is default), ASSP uses scheduled times to shutdown or restart ( AutoRestartCmd )! The syntax is the same like in ! To disable this Scheduler leave this field blank! Never write quotes in to this field!
This requires an installed  module in PERL.
Time and Date specification

Entry is the specification of the scheduled time in crontab format,
which contains five mandatory time and date fields.
Entry can be either a plain string, which contains
a whitespace separated time and date specification.

The time and date fields are (taken mostly from 'Vixie' cron):

<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH='50%' >
<tr><td>field</td><td>values</td></tr>
<tr><td>minute</td><td>0-59</td></tr>
<tr><td>hour</td><td>0-23</td></tr>
<tr><td>day of month</td><td>1-31</td></tr>
<tr><td>month</td><td>1-12 (or as names)</td></tr>
<tr><td>day of week</td><td>0-7 (0 or 7 is Sunday, or as names )</td></tr>
<tr><td>seconds</td><td>0-59 (optional) not supported inside ASSP !!!</td></tr>
</table>

 A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for
 'first-last'.

 Ranges of numbers are  allowed.  Ranges are two numbers
 separated  with  a  hyphen.   The  specified  range  is
 inclusive.   For example, 8-11  for an  'hours' entry
 specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.

 Lists  are allowed.   A list  is a  set of  numbers (or
 ranges)  separated by  commas.   Examples: '1,2,5,9',
 '0-4,8-12'.

 Step  values can  be used  in conjunction  with ranges.
 Following a range with '/<number>' specifies skips of
 the  numbers value  through the  range.   For example,
 '0-23/2' can  be used in  the hours field  to specify
 command execution every  other hour (the alternative in
 the V7 standard is '0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22').
 Steps are  also permitted after an asterisk,  so if you
 want to say 'every two hours', just use '*/2'.

 Names can also  be used for the 'month'  and 'day of
 week'  fields.  Use  the  first three  letters of  the
 particular day or month (case doesn't matter).

 Note:
       The day of a command's execution can be specified
       by two fields  -- day of month, and  day of week.
       If both fields are restricted (ie, aren't *), the
       command will be run when either field matches the
       current  time.  For  example, '30  4 1,15  * 5'
       would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the
       1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday

Examples:

<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH='80%' >
<tr><td>8 0 * * *</td><td>==></td><td>8 minutes after midnight, every day</td></tr>
<tr><td>5 11 * * Sat,Sun</td><td>==></td><td>at 11:05 on each Saturday and Sunday</td></tr>
<tr><td>0-59/5 * * * *</td><td>==></td><td>every five minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>42 12 3 Feb Sat</td><td>==></td><td>at 12:42 on 3rd of February and on each Saturday in February</td></tr>
<tr><td>32 11 * * * 0-30/2</td><td>==></td><td>11:32:00, 11:32:02, ... 11:32:30 every day</td></tr>
</table>

In addition, ranges or lists of names are allowed.
If you want to define multiple entries separate them by '|'

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
"
Use this option to schedule configuration changes. You must use the file option like 'file:files/configchangeschedule.txt' to define schedules - an empty value disables this feature.
 Define one schedule per line - comments are not allowed in a schedule definition line!
 The line has to start with the schedule string ( see ReStartSchedule ) followed by the variable (or hidden variable ) name to change, followed by ':=', followed by the value to change the variable to - like:
 8 0 * * * myNameAlso:=otherhost1.mydomain.tld
 0 6 * * *|0 10 * * * myNameAlso:=otherhost2.mydomain.tld
 0 1 * * * debug:=1
 0 2 * * * debug:=
 The schedule string can contain multiple schedule definitions separated by pipe'|'. You will get errors if:
 - the schedule definiton is wrong
 - the variable name is wrong (does not exists)
 - the syntax of the value is wrong
 Notice - assp will only check the syntax at definition time - the logical correctness of the value will be checked at the scheduled time! So, assp will (for example) not check any dependencies at definition time - if a dependency is wrong, the change request at the scheduled time will fail!
 Notice - all configuration changes are done with 'root' permission! For this reason, this configuration parameter is only visable to root and it is stored encrypted!
 For advanced users ONLY:
 Using the following extension, requires a deep internal knowledge of the assp code!
 It is also possible to schedule a call to an internal assp subroutine. The name of the subroutine has to begin with a '&amp;', the parameters that should passed to the subroutine must be in '()' - like:
 0 6 * * * &amp;subname(var1,var2,..,...)
 0 7 * * * &amp;subname()
 Notice: the subroutine will be called in the MainThread and syntax check will be done at run time - possible errors are shown in the log!

    DESCRIPTION
"
If not set to 'noschedule' (noschedule is default) , ASSP uses scheduled times to run the RebuildSpamdb! The syntax is the same like in ! To disable the Scheduler write 'noschedule'! Never write quotes in to this field!
This requires an installed  module in PERL.
It is possible to define more than one scheduled time per day to keep the Bayesian and HMM databes up to date, but this is not required - use 'newReportedInterval' instead.
If a file C:/assp/rebuilddebug.txt exists, the rebuild task will write the debug output to this file.
Time and Date specification

Entry is the specification of the scheduled time in crontab format,
which contains five mandatory time and date fields.
Entry can be either a plain string, which contains
a whitespace separated time and date specification.

The time and date fields are (taken mostly from 'Vixie' cron):

<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH='50%' >
<tr><td>field</td><td>values</td></tr>
<tr><td>minute</td><td>0-59</td></tr>
<tr><td>hour</td><td>0-23</td></tr>
<tr><td>day of month</td><td>1-31</td></tr>
<tr><td>month</td><td>1-12 (or as names)</td></tr>
<tr><td>day of week</td><td>0-7 (0 or 7 is Sunday, or as names )</td></tr>
<tr><td>seconds</td><td>0-59 (optional) not supported inside ASSP !!!</td></tr>
</table>

 A field may be an asterisk (*), which always stands for
 'first-last'.

 Ranges of numbers are  allowed.  Ranges are two numbers
 separated  with  a  hyphen.   The  specified  range  is
 inclusive.   For example, 8-11  for an  'hours' entry
 specifies execution at hours 8, 9, 10 and 11.

 Lists  are allowed.   A list  is a  set of  numbers (or
 ranges)  separated by  commas.   Examples: '1,2,5,9',
 '0-4,8-12'.

 Step  values can  be used  in conjunction  with ranges.
 Following a range with '/<number>' specifies skips of
 the  numbers value  through the  range.   For example,
 '0-23/2' can  be used in  the hours field  to specify
 command execution every  other hour (the alternative in
 the V7 standard is '0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20,22').
 Steps are  also permitted after an asterisk,  so if you
 want to say 'every two hours', just use '*/2'.

 Names can also  be used for the 'month'  and 'day of
 week'  fields.  Use  the  first three  letters of  the
 particular day or month (case doesn't matter).

 Note:
       The day of a command's execution can be specified
       by two fields  -- day of month, and  day of week.
       If both fields are restricted (ie, aren't *), the
       command will be run when either field matches the
       current  time.  For  example, '30  4 1,15  * 5'
       would cause a command to be run at 4:30 am on the
       1st and 15th of each month, plus every Friday

Examples:

<table BORDER CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH='80%' >
<tr><td>8 0 * * *</td><td>==></td><td>8 minutes after midnight, every day</td></tr>
<tr><td>5 11 * * Sat,Sun</td><td>==></td><td>at 11:05 on each Saturday and Sunday</td></tr>
<tr><td>0-59/5 * * * *</td><td>==></td><td>every five minutes</td></tr>
<tr><td>42 12 3 Feb Sat</td><td>==></td><td>at 12:42 on 3rd of February and on each Saturday in February</td></tr>
<tr><td>32 11 * * * 0-30/2</td><td>==></td><td>11:32:00, 11:32:02, ... 11:32:30 every day</td></tr>
</table>

In addition, ranges or lists of names are allowed.
If you want to define multiple entries separate them by '|'

    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
"
If set to 'drop TLS', any STARTTLS request will be removed from the protocol stack and no connection will ever go in to any TLS mode!
  If set to 'TLS to Proxy' and both peers (client and server) supports TLS, both connection will be moved in to a transparent Proxy mode. All data will be encrypted and unreadable to ASSP.
  If set to 'do TLS', ASSP will be the 'man in the middle'. ASSP will try to move both connections in to TLS. All data will be readable to ASSP - so all checks could be done. If any of the peers does not support TLS, ASSP will fake this (250-STARTTLS) to the other peer. So it could be possible, that the connection to the client is going in to TLS mode, even if TLS is not supported by the server. If a client does not request TLS (STARTTLS) even it has got the (250-STARTTLS), ASSP tries to start a TLS session to server, if he has sent (250-STARTTLS)! This behavior belongs to incoming and outgoing messages. This option requires the installed perl module !
  For 'do TLS' a server-certificate-file ' SSLCertFile ' and a server-key-file ' SSLKeyFile ' must exist and must be valid!
  If you do not have valid certificates, you may generate both files online with  or you may use OpenSSL to generate ! If you have installed OpenSSL (must be in PATH) and installed and enabled IO::Socket::SSL and ASSP is unable to find valid certificates - ASSP will try to create them at startup!

If enabled and enableWebAdminSSL is set to ON, each browser session is forced to provide a valid SSL client certificate. If no certificate is provided by the client, the connection will fail! To extend the verification of the certificate, use SSLWEBCertVerifyCB . Per default are used 'SSL_VERIFY_PEER | SSL_VERIFY_FAIL_IF_NO_PEER_CERT | SSL_VERIFY_CLIENT_ONCE'
  To create a PKCS12 from the PEM formated cert- and key file you can use openssl, like : 
  openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -in client.pem -inkey client.key -out client.p12
  The file client.p12 could now be imported in to your browser.
  !!! Install a valid certificate in to your browser BEFORE you enable this option - otherwise the GUI will get inaccessable !!!

    DESCRIPTION
"
If used, assp will call the defined subroutine as SSL->SSL_verify_callback in an eval closure submitting the original ARRAY of parameters (see the IO::Socket::SSL documentation).
  The subroutine has to return 1 on certificate verification success - otherwise 0.
  You can use/modify the module lib/CorrectASSPcfg.pm to implement your code. For example
  sub checkWebSSLCert {
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my ($OpenSSLSays,$CertStackPtr,$DN,$OpenSSLError, $Cert)=@_;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my $subject = Net::SSLeay::X509_NAME_oneline(Net::SSLeay::X509_get_subject_name($Cert));
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my $chain = Net::SSLeay::PEM_get_string_X509($Cert);
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...any code...;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my $success = eval{verify($Cert);};
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return $OpenSSLSays if $@;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my $user = eval{get_owner($Cert);};
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return $OpenSSLSays if $@;
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;my $pass = get_pass($user);};
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;@main::ExtWebAuth = ($user,$pass)
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return $success;
  }
  Now, if you set this parameter to 'CorrectASSPcfg::checkWebSSLCert' - assp will call
  CorrectASSPcfg::checkWebSSLCert->(@_);
  The variable '@main::ExtWebAuth' could be used to authenticate the user to the GUI related to the used certificate. The username must be provided as first element of the array. The password could be provided as second element of the array - this is not recommended and it is not required! If the used certificate is valid and a known adminusername (root is provided) is stored as first element in '@main::ExtWebAuth', the user will be automaticaly logged on to the GUI.
  NOTICE: This option will not work if you use any self signed certificate!

 linux/MacOS - grep '\[spam found\]' *maillog.txt &gt; bmaillog.txt
 Windows - find '[spam found]' *maillog.txt &gt; bmaillog.txt

EmailBlockReport  OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING
    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
"
Any mail sent by local/authenticated users to this username will be interpreted as a request to get a report about blocked emails. Do not put the full address here, just the user part. For example: asspblock
 Leading digits/numbers in the mail subject will be interpreted as 'report request for the last number of days'. If the number of days is not specified in the mail subject, a default of 5 days will be used to build the report. 
 All characters behind the 'number of days' will be interpreted as a regular expression to overwrite the BlockReportFilter - leading and trailing white spaces will be ignored.
 Users defined in EmailBlockTo, EmailAdmins and EmailAdminReportsTo are 'Admins' and can request a report for multiple users. They have to use a special syntax with '=>' in the body of the report request. The syntax is: 
 QueryAddress=>ReportRecipient=>ReportDays  -  there are many possible combinations of this three parameters. For example:
 user@domain and user@domain=>user@domain - will send a report for this user to this user
 *@domain (better use) *@domain=>* - will send a report for every blocked user in this domain to this user
 user@domain=>recipient@any-domain - will send a report for user@domain to recipient@any-domain
 *@domain=>recipient@any-domain - will send a report for every blocked user in this domain to recipient@any-domain
 It is possible to define a group ( Groups ) in the first parameter like:
 [user@domain]=>recipient@any-domain
 The group name must be a lower case email address of a local domain without any wildcard. This will create a combined block report for all email addresses defined in this group - useful, if someone has multiple email addresses and want's to get a single report.
 If the group name is equal to a real existing email address of a user, and this user requests a block report using this email address (MAIL FROM:), a combined block report for the group will be generated.
 A third parameter is possible to set, which defines the number of days for which the report should be created. The default (if empty or not defined) is one day. This value is used to calculate the 'next run date'. For example:
 *@domain=>recipient@any-domain=>2 - creates a report for two days.
 *@domain=>*=>14 - creates a report for 14 days.
 user@domain=>=>3 or user@domain=>*=>3 - creates a report for three days. The second parameter is here empty or *.
 To overwrite the defined BlockReportFilter, you can define a fourth parameter, which contains the regular expression to use.
 *@domain=>*=>14=>virus|newsletter - creates a report for 14 days and skips all lines that contains the words 'virus' or 'newsletter'.
 If an admin emails a block report request and specifies a filter in the subject of the email and a fourth parameter in the body, both regular expressions will be merged in to a single regex for each line.
 If you or a user want the default BlockReportFilter to become part of the overwrite regex, the literal '$BRF' should be inluded in the regex like:
 *@domain=>*=>14=>virus|$BRF|newsletter - or even in the subject of the email
 In this case the literal '$BRF' will be replaced by the BlockReportFilter.
 Only Admins are able to request blockreports for non local email addresses. For example:
 user@non_local_domain=>recipient@any-domain=>4
 *@non_local_domain=>recipient@any-domain=>4
 This will result in an extended blockreport for the non local address(es). Replace 'non_local_domain' with the domain name you want to query for.
 It is possible to change the complete design of the BlockReports to your needs,  using a html-css file. An default css-file 'blockreport.css' is in the image folder.
 There you can also find a default icon file 'blockreporticon.gif' and a default header-image-file 'blockreport.gif' - which is the same like 'logo.gif'.  There is no need to install that fles. If assp can not find this files in its
 image folder, it will use default hardcoded css and icon. If the file 'blockreport.gif' is not found 'logo.gif' will be used.
 To change any contents, use the Blockreport::modify module in the lib folder. You'll need some Perl skills to do that.

If you have more than two ASSP, the logical sending structure must be a star. If ASSP(A) (the sun) is in the middle and you have also ASSP(B), ASSP(C) and ASSP(D) (satelites), ASSP(A) should know C,B and D, and B,C and D should only know A.
  If a forward host is unreachable, the forward request will be queued for a maximum of 24 hours and the user will be informed sending the 'reports/blockreportforwarderror.txt' file.

  If an address of an EmailAdmin is defined multiple times, all entries are used in an 'AND' logic.
  If a BlockReport is requested for a not allowed email address, the complete BlockReport request will be ignored.

This enables the AgentX registration of assp to a SNMP master-AgentX. ASSP will be registered to the master-AgentX as 'assp_myName', the possible configuration file name will be assp_myName.conf . This option requires the installed perl module . The product and needed librarys could be downloaded at .
 All configuration values are accessed using the SNMPUser account. The SNMP-permission and visibility is used from the configured user GUI-permissions.
The following OIDs (relative to the SNMPBaseOID) are available for SNMP-querys. The configuration values are changeable via snmp. The file mib/ASSP-MIB could be used in SNMP browsers to get a human readable view of the OID's (copy it to the net-snmp MIB file location - eg: [C:]/usr/share/snmp/mibs and the MIB location of your SNMP browser). Please keep in mind, that an extensive usage of SNMP querys will slow down assp.

POP3ConfigFile  OBJECT-TYPE
    SYNTAX      OCTET STRING
    MAX-ACCESS  read-write
    STATUS      current
    DESCRIPTION
"
The file with a valid POP3 configuration. Only the file: option is allowed to use. 
  If the file exists and contains at least one valid POP3 configuration line and POP3Interval is configured, assp will collect the messages from the configured POP3-servers. 
  Each line in the config file contains one configuration for one user.
  All spaces will be removed from each line.
  Anything behind a # or ; is consider a comment.
  If the same POP3-user-name is used multiple times, put two angles with a unique number behind the user name. The angles and the number will be removed while processing the configuration.
  e.g: pop3user&lt;1&gt; will result in pop3user  -  or  - myName@pop3.domain&lt;12&gt; will result in myName@pop3.domain
  It is possible to define commonly used parameters in a separate line, which begins with the case sensitive POP3-username 'COMMON:=' - followed by the parameters that should be used for every configured user.
  A commonly set parameter could be overwritten in every user definition.
  Each configuration line begins with the POP3-username followed by ':=' : e.g myPOP3userName:=
  This statement has to followed by pairs of parameter names and values which are separated by commas - the pairs inside are separated by '='. 
  e.g.: POP3username&lt;num&gt;:=POP3password=pop3_pass,POP3server=mail.gmail.com,SMTPsendto=demo@demo_smtp.local,......
  The following case sensitive keywords are supported in the config file:
  POP3password=pop3_password
  POP3server=POP3-server or IP[:Port]
  SMTPsender=email_address
  SMTPsendto=email_address or &lt;TO:&gt; or &lt;TO:email_address&gt;
  SMTPserver=SMTP-server[:Port]
  SMTPHelo=myhelo
  SMTPAUTHuser=smtpuser
  SMTPAUTHpassword=smtppass
  POP3SSL=0/1
  POP3SSL, SMTPHelo, SMTPsender, SMTPAUTHuser and SMTPAUTHpassword are optional.
  If POP3SSL is set to 1 - POP3S will be done! The Perl module  is required for POP3S!
  If SMTPsender is not defined, the FROM: address from the header line will be used - if this is not found the POP3username will be used.
  If the &lt;TO:&gt; syntax is used for SMTPsendto, the mail will be sent to any recipient that is found in the 'to: cc: bcc:' header lines if it is a local one.
  If the &lt;TO:email_address&gt; syntax is used for SMTPsendto, the literals NAME and/or DOMAIN will be replaced by the name part and/or domain part of the addresses found in the 'to: cc: bcc:' header lines. This makes it possible to collect POP3 mails from a POP3 account, which holds mails for multiple recipients.
  For example: &lt;TO:NAME@mydomain.com&gt;  or  &lt;TO:NAME@subdomain.DOMAIN&gt;  or  &lt;TO:central-account@DOMAIN&gt;
  If the &lt;TO:&gt; or &lt;TO:email_address&gt; syntax is used for SMTPsendto, 'localDomains' and/or 'localAddresses_Flat' must be configured to prevent too much error for wrong recipients defined in the 'to: cc: bcc:' header lines. The POP3collector will not do any LDAP or VRFY query!
  If you want assp to detect SPAM, use the listenPort or listenPort2 as SMTP-server.
  To use this feature, you have to install the perl script 'assp_pop3.pl' in the assp- base directory.

    DESCRIPTION
"
If the size of an undecoded attachment exceeds the ASSP_AFCinsize or ASSP_AFCoutsize parameter, assp will call this script and will replace the attachment with the text returned by this script or executable.
  If no text is returned by the script (a warning is written to the maillog.txt) or the returned text begins with the word 'error', the attachment will not be replaced.
  The script has to write the resulting text or error to STDOUT.
  The resulting text could be any of plain text or html code. The MIME-enconding and the Content-Type value of the resulting MIME-part will be set accordingly.
  The text should contain the link to download the attachment, possibly some explanation (eg. download life time), web login information or a web-session-identifier - what ever is needed to fit the requirements of your web server.
  You have to define the full path to the script and all parameters that should be pass to the script. The literal FILENAME will be replaced with the attachment filename (including the full path) that was stored in the /transfer folder. Any literal starting with an '$', will be replaced by the according connection hash value or the global variable with the name.
  for example:
  $relayok will be replaced by $Con->{relayok} - which identifies if it is an incoming (1) or outgoing/local (0) mail
  So a possible definition of this parameter could be: 
  '/usr/bin/move_attachment_to_web.sh $relayok FILENAME' 
  or 
  'c:/assp/move_attachment_to_web.cmd $relayok FILENAME'
  The file has to be removed by the script. If not, assp will warn about this and will remove the file in the /transfer folder.
  To keep the filenames unique, the assp message identifier is placed in front of the filename - like: M1-30438-02027_attachmentfilename. Notice: if the filename contains unicode characters, assp will pass this characters in UTF-8 to your script!
  Keep in mind, that if this script terminates it's own process - ASSP will die!

If set, encrypted or password protected compressed attachments will be blocked or replaced according to ASSP_AFCSelect and ASSP_AFCReplBadAttach .
 To define a user based check of compressed attachments, configure 'UserAttach'. This plugin enhance the definiton options for UserAttach. In addition to the existing options, the following syntax could be used:
 For example:
 zip:user@domain.tld => good => ai|asc|bhx|dat|doc|eps|zip
 zip:*@domain.tld => good => ai|asc|bhx , good-out => eps|gif , good-in => htm|html , block => pdf|ppt , block-out => rar|rpt , block-in => xls|exe\-bin|crypt\-zip|encrypt
 Those definitions (leading zip:) are only used inside compressed files.
 The extension 'crypt-zip' could be used to allow or deni encrypted compressed attachments for users at any compression level.
 The extension 'encrypt' could be used to allow or deni encrypted (eg. aes) for users.
 The following compression formats/extensions are supported: tar.gz,tgz,gz,tar,zip,jar,ear,war,par,tbz,tbz2,tar.bz,tar.bz2,bz2,Z,lzma,txz,tar.xz,xz.
 The detection of compressed files is done content based not filename extension based.
 Depending on your Perl distribution, it could be possible that you must install additionaly 'IO::Compress::...' (for example: IO::Compress:Lzma) modules to support the compression methodes.

    DESCRIPTION
"
If configured, outgoing mails will be digitaly signed according to the SMIME specifications.
 It is possible to configure privat and/or corporate signatures. In any case, the 'file:' option must be used - specify one configuration per line.
 The domain or user is separated by '=&gt;' from the signing configuration/policy. It is possible to use group definitions of domains and users using the [ Groups ] option. Define one line per domain or user or group.
 Configuration entries are separated by comma.
 Configuration entry pairs (tag and value) are separated by '='.
 File definitions for the certificate and privat key have to include the full path to the file! Certificate and privat key have to be provided in PEM format
 If you exchange any certificate or key file, click 'Edit file' and save the file again to force a reload of the internal certificate store.
 The domain / user part accepts full email addresses , domains and groups - wildcards are supported and must be used for domain definitions.
 The domain / user part is compaired to the envelope sender - the first matching entry (in reverse generic order) will be used. Entries starting with a minus sign, explicit exclude the domain/user/group from SMIME processing.
 certfile - is required and specifys the full path to the certificate to use. The subject of the certificate has to include a valid email address. In normal case, this email address is specified by the cert-subject-tag 'emailAddress'. The 'FROM:' address in the mail header will be replaced by this email address and a 'Reply-To:' line with the original sender is added (or replaced) to the mail header.
 If the subject of the certificate specifys the email address in another tag, define this tag (NOT the email address) after 'emailaddress='.
 keyfile - is required and specifys the full path to the file that contains the privat key
 keypass - the tag is required, the value is optional - defines the password required (or not) for the privat key
 emailaddress - is optional - please read 'certfile'
 rcpt - is optional - include/[-]exclude mails to specified users and/or domains (recipients) - to exclude addresses, write a minus in front - separate multiple entries by space
 examples:
 - (1) user@your.domain =&gt; certfile=/certs/user_cert.pem, keyfile=/certs/user_key.pem, keypass=, rcpt=-otheruser@other.domain
 - (2) *your.domain =&gt; certfile=/certs/corporate_cert.pem, keyfile=/certs/corporate_key.pem, keypass=mypassword
 - (3) *@your.domain =&gt; certfile=/certs/corporate_cert.pem, keyfile=/certs/corporate_key.pem, keypass= , emailaddress=Email
 - (4) -user4@your.domain
 - (5) -*@*.your.domain
 - (6) -[no_smime]
 The first example specifys a privat signing policy which exclude the recipient otheruser@other.domain, the second and third example specifys a corporate signing policy (with and without subdomains). The fourth example excludes the user 'user4@your.domain' from SMIME processing. The fives example excludes all subdomains of 'your.domain' from SMIME processing. The last example excludes all domains, subdomains and users defined in the group '[no_smime]' from SMIME processing.
 corporate SMIME signing:
 Assume we define the following configuration line:
 *@your.domain.com =&gt; certfile=/certs/corporate_cert.pem, keyfile=/certs/corporate_key.pem, keypass=
 Now let's say, the subject of the specified certificate (corporate_cert.pem) contains .../emailAddress=central.office@your.domain.com/...
 Your local user 'mark.schmitz@your.domain.com' sends a mail to an external recipient. The related mail header is:
 From: 'Mark Schmitz' &lt;mark.schmitz@your.domain.com&gt;
 Disposition-Notification-To: &lt;mark.schmitz@your.domain.com&gt;
 After SMIME signing the mail, the related mail headers are the following:
 From: 'Mark Schmitz' &lt;central.office@your.domain.com&gt;
 Disposition-Notification-To: &lt;mark.schmitz@your.domain.com&gt;
 Reply-To: &lt;mark.schmitz@your.domain.com&gt;
 The mail client of the recipient will validate the signature against the 'From' address - which corresponds to the email address specified in the subject of the certificate -> VALID
 Pressing the 'REPLY/ANSWER' button, the mail client will provide 'mark.schmitz@your.domain.com' as recipient address using the entry in the 'Reply-To:' header.
 Notice, that some bad and/or older mail clients are ignoring the 'Reply-To:' header tag - in such case an answered mail will go to 'central.office@your.domain.com'.
 ASSP will help you a bit to prevent this. In addition to the required mail header changes, assp will add or enhance the 'References:' mail header tag with a value of 'assp-corp-smime-EMAILADDRESS' , where EMAILADDRESS is the original sender address.
 If assp receives an answered mail, it will look for such an entry in the mail header and will add the found email address to the 'To' header, if it is not already found there.

 You have to open UDP port 6277 on your firewall for outgoing connections and dccifd must be installed an running. This port is used by dccifd to connect to the DCC-Servers.
 Please notice that dccifd is not available on windows systems. To use DCC on windows you must install the DCC components on a second linux system and you have to configure ASSP_DCCdccifd to use an IP socket to connect to the dccifd. Please follow the installation instructions on 
 DCC is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and filtering network. Through user contribution, DCC establishes a distributed and constantly updating catalogue of spam in propagation that is consulted by email clients to filter out known spam. Detection is done with statistical signatures that efficiently spot mutating spam content. User input is validated through reputation assignments based on consensus on report and revoke assertions which in turn is used for computing confidence values associated with individual signatures.

This Plugin uses a service provided by www.cloudmark.com to detect spam on a statistical base.
 You have to open port 2703 on your firewall for outgoing connections. This port is used by Razor to connect to the Razor-Servers.
 Razor is a distributed, collaborative, spam detection and filtering network. Through user contribution, Razor establishes a distributed and constantly updating catalogue of spam in propagation that is consulted by email clients to filter out known spam. Detection is done with statistical and randomized signatures that efficiently spot mutating spam content. User input is validated through reputation assignments based on consensus on report and revoke assertions which in turn is used for computing confidence values associated with individual signatures.
 This plugin is designed for- and running in call/run level 'complete mail'!
