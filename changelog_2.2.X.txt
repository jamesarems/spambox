fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 13020:


- the CDB lock cause an exception in the rebuildspamdb task
  Error: rebuildspamdb failed - CDS not enabled for this database at sub main::BDB_DELETE line 4 thread 2 
	 
	 
	 
2013-01-19
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 13019:


- All listeners can now be defined according to the RFC's 3330,3513 and 2606. It is possible to use multiple
  loopback and interface addresses with the same port for different listeners. This is not the case if the universal
  ip address 0.0.0.0 / :: is used (port only definition)
  
- Multiple problems related to the SRS engine are solved.  

- It was possible that a BerkeleyDB locking issue has crashed spambox, CDB locking is now enabled in every case.

changed:

- The following default values are changed:

['fiphValencePB','Suspicious HELO: IP in HELO, default=39 +' (old - 5)
['fiphmValencePB','Suspicious HELO: IP in HELO mismatch, default=60 +' (old - 5)

- new SPAMBOX-MIB file released



2013-01-13
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 13013:

- DKIM caused an exception and a restarting worker, if it was unable to fetch the domain policy or the policy
  was syntactical wrong
  
- In some cases it was possible that the analyzer has shown different Bayesian results compared to the realtime
  scanner (even if the same spamdb was used).
  
- spambox_pop3.pl 1.10 included a wrong helo string in to the received header line if a port number was added to the
  pop3-host , like : pop3host@domain.org:995. This caused a failing HELO check in spambox.
  
  spambox_pop3.pl version 1.11 solves this problem
      

- If the 'newReportedInterval' feature was used and a still existing corpus file was copied to "error/.../newManualyAdded",
  the Rebuild-Thread was going in to an infinity loop until this file was removed from the 'newManualyAdded' folder.




2013-01-12
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 13012:

- the changed DNS implementation for DKIM has thrown exceptions like
  
  Error: Worker_4: DNS error: query timed out
  Error: Worker_2: no domain to fetch policy for

  it was also possible that this changes caused hanging spambox
  

changed:

- the mail-analyzer is now able to do DKIM and DMARC checks

- an new SPAMBOX-MIB file is released

- The following hidden configuration variables are now available in the GUI. After upgrading spambox, remove
  the related lines from lib/CorrectSPAMBOXcfg.pm and setup the values in the GUI.

AddURIS2MyHeader = 0;               # (0/1) URI's detected with URIBLOK are added to myheader (X-Spambox-Detected-URI:)
localnoDelayAddresses = 0;          # (0/1) skip delaying if the recipient matches 'noDelayAddresses' (incoming mail only)
AllowInternalsInRegex = 0;          # (0/1) allow internal variables in regexes - replace something like ${$EmailDomainRe} with the value of $EmailDomainRe
enableStrongRegexOptimization = 0;  # (0/1) enable the strong optimization of regular expressions
removeForeignBCC = 0;               # (0/1) remove foreign bcc: header lines from the mail header
DoT10Stat = 0;                      # (0/1) enable the top ten statistic count and the output in the GUI and BlockReports for admins
host2IPminTTL = 300;                # (number > 60) min TTL used for config reload if hostnames are defined for any IP regex

NpWlTimeOut = 1200;                 # timeout in seconds for noprocessing and whitelisted mails
maxDNSRespDist = 50;                # (number > 0) max DNS responstime change in ms before the order of the name servers should be changed


added:

'newReportedInterval','Interval for processing new Reported Mails',
 File count and interval definition (count minutes) for processing new reported mails (correctedspam , correctednotspam)
  - process if at least 'first value' mails are reported but every 'second value' minutes.
 Set the first value to zero to disable this feature.
 If enabled, new reported mails or files moved in to the corpus via GUI are used, to immediatly update the Spamdb
 and HMMdb with the new information.
 This will keep the databases continuously uptodate and the RebuildSchedule interval could be increased, 
 if there are enough files in the corpus and your corpus norm is fine.
 If you need to copy/move several files from outside spambox in to the corpus and you want spambox to process them 
 immediatly, copy/move the files in to the subfolder "error/.../newManualyAdded".



2013-01-06
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 13006:

- shutting down SPAMBOX has thrown an exception
  'main exception: Not a HASH reference at sub main::clearDBCon line 11.'
  if BerkeleyDB was used for the main hashes and databases

- generating the black list for the global penalty box has removed too many entries from PBBlack

- a locked MySQL-cursor caused crashes in some cases


changed:

- improved DKIM preCheck and DMARC processing
- improved DNS query for DKIM checks



2012-12-31
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12366:

- spambox has not used the latest Perl Unicode support

- perlcritic now shows OK for spambox.pl

- the database table locking now depends on the data processed by the threads at the same time, so locking
  is only done if it is really required


changed:  

- addresses registerd in 'noPenaltyMakeTraps' are now ignored in 'spamtrapaddresses'

- all hints to the database driver 'mysqlPP - DBD::mysqlPP' are removed from the GUI, because this driver is not
  useable for SPAMBOX
  
  



2012-12-27
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12362:

- If 'adminusersdb' was set to 'DB:' it was possible that the database connection check and renew procedure
  has unexpected removed an existing database connection and spambox has logged the following messages:
  
[Worker_10000] Database select statement failed in AdminUsers(exists): MySQL server has gone away
[Worker_10000] Database select statement failed in AdminUsersRight(exists): MySQL server has gone away
[Worker_10000] Error: FIRSTKEY(AdminUsers): Can't execute select statement: MySQL server has gone away  


- Even if removing a 'PersonalBlackList' -entry has failed, spambox has logged, that the record was removed.

           info: removed personalblack record ....

- If a still existing 'TrapAddress' was added to 'noPenaltyMakeTraps' - this entry was processed as 'TrapAddress'.




2012-12-24
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12359:

- some no longer required code is removed

added:

- the hidden variable 'enableLockIPBox' is added (default is 1) to be able to switch off the IP-LockBox
  (see 12357 - 12358)



2012-12-23
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12358:

- the IP lockbox was not cleanedup correctly in build 12357 - which caused connection errors for some IP addresses until
  spambox was restarted



2012-12-22
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12357:

- if 'mysql' is used as database driver, spambox prevents foreign clients/servers from connections in
  different workers - this fixes the unexpected exceptions if the same IP was connected in different
  workers at the same time


- if spambox was not runing as user 'root' under linux and a listener was blocked by a DoS - spambox was 
  restarting - from now, spambox ignores the listener for 10 seconds in this case
  

- in some cases spambox has tried to write a 'NULL' key in to the 'pkey' field of a database table,
  which cased an error message
  
  
  

2012-12-17
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12352:

- the commitment control for transactional databases was missing in the database import routines

- In case of an DNS query error, a thread could die resolving the MX record of a domain with
  'Error: Worker_1: ***  FATAL PROGRAM ERROR!!     Unknown method 'exchange''
  this exception is now catched

- changing the 'relayPort' parameter caused an internal error exception
  'error: coding error: config value is not equal config hash in relayPort - please report to development!'


changed:

- To reduce the overhead for database handling, the required concurrent connections to a database are reduced 
  to one connection per thread.

- improved commitment control for transactional databases

- improved DNS-server handling, because the usage order is less often switched

- if a personal blacklist entry is found for the envelope sender and recipient ('mail from:','rcpt to:')
  the reply is changed from '450 ..' to '550 ..' 



2012-12-10
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12345:

- If a transactional database was used and the database driver option 'autocommit' was set to '0' (default is '1')
  (like   DBdriver:=mysql,...,autocommit=0,...)
  spambox has not executed the 'commit' statement after adding or changing a record - nor the 'rollback' statement
  in case of an error - which possibly caused unexpected crashes of the Perl process.

changed:

- If 'mysql' is used as database, spambox now reduces the count of submited SQL-statements for inserted and updated
  records.
  Instead the mechanism ' EXISTS ? UPDATE : INSERT ' - the mechanism ' INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ... '
  is used. 
  This keeps the mysql IX-record-lock until the operation has been finished and it keeps the data consistent in case
  the same record is added or changed by multiple threads at the same time.
  
  

2012-12-08
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12343:

- if the MaintenanceThread(10000) was too busy to execute requested task and those tasks were moved in to
  the RebuildThread(10001) - some of the task were not executed because of missing database connections
  
- the complete database engine was redesigned to prevent infinity database record looks, which could cause
  unexpected crashes
  
- if the DKIM-pre-check feature was configured and the DKIM-Cache was tied to a database - spambox was some times
  unexpected dieing, if the same IP was connected to different workers at the same time
  
- the 'fillspamfiles' task was not working correct, this caused the 'prevent duplicate subject files' feature to start
  new counts at each spambox startup (ignoring existing files in spam folder)
  
        


2012-11-08
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12313:

- after an upgrade of the module Thread::Queue to version 3.01 spambox dies on an exception



2012-11-07
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12312:

- using build 12311, some of our received lines were not written correct for multiple emails in one connection

- multiple emails in one connection could cause memory access violations if the different emails have too different
  size and the module Convert::Scalar is installed and enabled


2012-11-06
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12311:

- fixes several problems if multiple emails were received in a single connection, because of  not reseted states

- some emails were not resent

- tries to fix undetected IP addresses on some linux platforms

- if a wrong HELO was detected in an ISP-connection, the wrong helo was shown in the maillog.txt

- the database locking was not working correct, if 'lockDatabases' was set to '1'


changed:

the default value of 'AddIntendedForHeader' ('Add Envelope-Recipient Header') is changed to '1'



2012-10-30
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12305:

- the rebuildspamdb has not processed the files in the reversed creation time order
- DMARC reports to multiple addresses were not working
- the log-output for SPAMMER SPF records was some times wromg
- QuotedPrintable reports were some times wrong MIME-encoded


changed:

Setting the new 'WhitelistPrivacyLevel', the whitelist is used in a more privat manner (see added).


added:


'WhitelistPrivacyLevel','PrivacyLevel of the Whitelist','0:global & privat(legacy)|1:domain & privat|2:privat only',
 'Sets the privacy level of the whitelistdb . If an (local) user adds an email address to the whitelist:
 
  (0) global & privat - this email address is automaticaly whitelisted for all other local users
  (1) domain & privat - this email address is automaticaly whitelisted for all other local users in the same local domain
  (2) privat only - this email address is only whitelisted for this single local user<br /><br />
  (0-1) unless another user has removed this email address from his whitelist. Default is zero, which is the legacy setting.
  NOTICE: independend from this setting, the whitelistdb is filled with all three entries (global,domain,privat), 
  to make it possible to change this value.'




2012-10-02
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12276:

- The DKIM-signature was still not added to resent mails.

- If spambox has created more than one DMARC report since the last restart, only the first one was correct.

changed:

- an new spambox/spambox.mod/install/mod_inst.pl verion 1.48 is released
- an new spambox.mod.zip is released
- an new SPAMBOX_MIB is released


2012-10-01
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12275:

- In case a local blocked mail was resent, no DKIM signature and no Message-ID-signature were added to the mail.

- copying files in the GUI to 'correctedspam' or 'correctednotspam' was leading in to wrong modified
  personal blacklist entries


changed:

- 'DoDKIM','Validate DomainKeys Identified Mail' 
 ..... In addition DKIM is used to process Domain-based Message Authentication, 
 Reporting & Conformance - described in <a href="http://www.dmarc.org/" rel="external">DMARC</a> 
 (DMARC requires also ValidateSPF to be enabled)
 
- 'ValidateSPF','Enable SPF Validation',
  .... and Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance - described in 
  <a href="http://www.dmarc.org/" rel="external">DMARC</a> (DMARC requires also DoDKIM to be enabled).

- An "X-Original-Authentication-Results: " header is now added by spambox;
 

added:

- SPAMBOX is now able to validate DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting & Conformance) and to 
    send agregate and forensic DMARC reports.

  - DMARC-reports could be only sent, if the rua- and ruf-DMARC policy of a domain contains the 'mailto:' tag
    reports are not supported via any other protocol than SMTP(s)
  - DMARC-reports are not sent if 'DMARCReportFrom' is not set
  - DMARC validation requires that 'ValidateSPF' and 'DoDKIM' are enabled
  - DMARC validation is auto-switched to on if 'ValidateSPF' and 'DoDKIM' are enabled
  - 'spfValencePB' is used to score DMARC errors
  - forensic DMARC-reports are only sent if any of the 'adkim'/'aspf' policies of a domain are set to 'strict'
    and the DMARC check has been failed
  - if 'SPFLog' is set verbose or 'DEBUGSPF' is set to on, a copy of the XML report and of the email are 
    stored in the /debug folder  

- 'DMARCReportFrom','From Address for DMARC Reports',
  'The email address to be used as FROM: address to send <a href="http://www.dmarc.org/" rel="external">DMARC</a> ´
  reports. If blank, no DMARC reports will be sent! If only the user name is defined, spambox will add the domain 
  name that belongs to the report.



2012-09-21
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12265:

- The MSGID-signature check and the BATV-check were no longer working since build 12229


changed:

- If multiple recipient replacement rules were defined using the same tag number, the last one was used.
  Now the first one keeps active and for all other indentical an error is written to the maillog.txt.


added:

- An new hidden config variable 'SPF_max_dns_interactive_terms' is available.
  For more information read the POD of Mail::SPF::Server !
  Change tis only if know what you are doing!

$SPF_max_dns_interactive_terms = 10; # max_dns_interactive_terms max number of SPF-mechanism per domain (defaults to 10)



2012-09-15
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12259:

- After an upgrade of the perl-ldap (Net::LDAP) module to version 0.46, it was possible that spambox could not
  contact the LDAP server anymore. This was the case, if the Perl module IO::Socket::INET6 was installed
  but the system has not supported IPv6.



2012-09-13
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12257:

- The rebuild task has possibly tried to correct the corpus by deleting files, even this was not required or
  useless



2012-09-12
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12256:

- The automatic corpus correction in the rebuildspamdb task was not working as expected in every case.
  There is one rebuild task required to enable this feature in future.
  You may use the 'RebuildTestMode' to speed up this single task.
  

added:

'RebuildTestMode','Run the Rebuild in Test Mode'
'If selected, all rebuildspamdb tasks will not populate the spamdb and hmmdb - and no data will be sent 
to the griplist-Server.'
  


2012-09-11
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12255:

- On some linux platforms we saw a CLIB mistake, which caused an IP address error in SPAMBOX.
  Even on a connected IP-socket, spambox was unable to get the connected IP address from the OS.
  This caused unexpected crashes or at least unexpected behavior of spambox. If this mistake is 
  detected by spambox, the connection is closed by spambox and 'delaySameIP' is switched to ON - which
  sets an internal limit for the count of same IP's in the same worker.
  The detected CLIB mistake is logged in the maillog.txt. In case you see
  
error: This system is some time unable to detect connected IP addresses - check that you use the latest C-library, 
Perl-version and Perl module versions  

and/or

error: unable to detect the connected IP address - ...

  check that you use the latest Perl update for your version, and the CLIB/LIBC of your OS is uptodate!
  
  
- If a system got peaks of spam or ham mails, the corpusnorm was no longer fine - even if the settings for
  the rebuildspamdb and corpus folder maintenance were not changed. SPAMBOX tries now on the fly to keep the 
  corpusnorm beween 0.9 and 1.1 . Notice this will only work, if there are enougth files in the corpus folders
  (~500 each at least).

  'autoCorrectCorpus'
  .......
  If this value is defined, spambox will use the middle value of "a" and "b" ((a+b)/2) as target corpusnorm and 
  will try to reach this value, using (as many as possible) but only such a count of files in the folders 
  spamlog and notspamlog as required!'
  

changed:

- The internal config variable 'delaySameIPorHelo' is changed to 'delaySameIP'

- On havy loaded systems it was possible that the 'command queue' of the MaintThread was growing
  for example, if the ARC plugin was used. If the RebuildThread is idle, he will also process entries from this
  'command queue'.

- If a connected host submits a HELO without a host or domain name, the host name is internaly replaced by 'localhost',
  but the original HELO is sent to the MTA. If 'DoInvalidFormatHelo' is enabled, the message and IP will get a penalty of
  'ihValencePB'.

- The SPAM-SPF-record detection is improved. All 'pass' matches with an IPv4-network-mask less than 8 or
  an IPv6-network-mask less than 32 are detected as 'fail'.

- If a SPAM-SPF-record is found in the SPFCache for a domain (0.0.0.0 domain) - this domain will be treated as 
  'blackListedDomain'


added:

- Until now the SMTP timeout for noprocessing and whitelisted mails was set hardcoded to 1200 seconds,
  you can change this timeout now with the internal config variable 'NpWlTimeOut'
our $NpWlTimeOut = 1200;  # timeout in seconds for noprocessing and whitelisted mails




2012-09-04
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12248:

- The detect bypass SPF records check was too restrictive and not 100% RFC-4408 conform.
  If you upgrade from build 12246, remove all entries from the SPFCache that starts with '0.0.0.0' 



2012-09-02
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12246:

changed:

- build 12245 introduced the detection of bypass SPF records - this feature is changed as follows:

If spambox finds such a SPF record for a domain, it changes the SPF result from 'pass' to 

'softfail' for SPF-policy '?all' 
'fail' for SPF-policy 'all' , '+all' , ''
'none' for all other suspiciouse SPF-policies



2012-09-01
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12245:

- Because spammers are mostly smart, they found a way to bypass all SPF checks for all domains they use in
  'HELO' and 'MAIL FROM'. They register the domain - and they publish a SPF record like
  'v=spf1 +all' or 'v=spf1 ~all'
  which means, that all IP's are allowed to send mails for this domain.
  If spambox finds such a SPF record for a domain, it changes the SPF result from 'pass' to 'none' (like:
  there is no SPF record) - and it register a SPFCache entry for the IP '0.0.0.0' and the domain.
  So there is no way for spammers to bypass the spambox SPF check using such SPF records.
  


changed:

'DoDomainIP','Check Number of IP\'s Per Domain',
 'This check is skipped if the IP and domain have passed the SPF-check. If ValidateSPF is enabled and an 
  IP/Domain reaches the maxSMTPdomainIP limit, the MaintThread starts a background SPF check to prevent 
  blocking good mails in future.'

'SPFtrusted' - is removed from the code and configuration


added:

'enableSPFbackground','Enable SPF Background Check'
 'SPF background checks are initiated by some features (for example DoDomainIP) to fillup the SPFCache. 
  The collected results are later used to prevent blocking good mails.



2012-08-30
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12243:

- In build 12242 SPAMBOX has shown a configuration error like:

AdminInfo: error - unable to resolve IP for hostname '10' in configuration of 'noDelay'

  The class A notation '10' (without a trailing dot) was never working - but build 12242 has this detected.
  This notation now works like expected.
  
  

2012-08-29
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12242:

- If a hostname was defined in an IP-list and the hostname was starting with [a-f] - the hostip was not resolved.

- Removing all entries related to an email address (user@domain.com,*) from the Whitelist was not working in every case.

- Depending on the used OS, Perl-version, LIBC/GLIBC - the rebuildspamdb task has not produced a
  Hidden-Markov-Model, because the internal HMM module has detected that it is running in a wrong environment.
  This behavior has started with version 2.2.1 build 12149


changed:

- The DoDomainIP check is skipped, if the sending domain/ip are validated by the SPF check as 'pass'.



2012-08-28
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12241:

- The periodical cleanup of the Whitelist was not working.

- The new Regex::Optimizer version 1.11 fixes a problem with IPv6 address optimizing.

- If the Whitelist or the PersonalBlackList contained many records and a DB was used for it, removing an entry caused 
  some times warnings about stucking workers or MainThread.

- In rare cases whitelisted mails were not stored in the right folder.

- Using both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses together in an IP-regular-expression (list) - causes an exception in all threads. 

- An RBL/RWL check for an IPv6 address some times caused a return code of 'domain name too long' and the check was skiped


changed:

- SPAMBOX now collects some more IP's for the GRIPLIST upload - the tag [PenaltyDelay] is used for this.




2012-08-24
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12237:

- Improved error handling and reporting in case the rebuildspamdb task is unable to produce a HMM.

- The URIBL top level domain regular expression was not working like expected.


changed:

- The 'work with IP-addresses' GUI dialog now accepts also hostnames. Hostnames are resolved to there IP-address.

- The 'work with IP-addresses' and the 'work with email-addresses' GUI dialog are now printing the matching results
  for all possible regular expressions at the bottom of the result field. 
  


2012-08-23
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12236:

- If the mail transmission for a good mail was aborted, spambox has stored the incomplete .eml file. 
  The .eml file is now removed in this case.

changed:

- The 'SMTP Connections'- and the 'Worker/DB/Regex Status'- screen now have a 'print' button to print the screen.

- The print output of the main configuration GUI now contains a TOC at the first page and a glosar at the bottom
  and the link is renamed to 'Print the Manual'.

  Notice: The parsing and printing of the manual could take several minutes, depending on the power of your 
          workstation and the used browser!
   

2012-08-20
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12233:

changed:

- Major improvement for DNS-server usage, checking and handling to speed up all DNS related tasks.
  All DNS queries are now spreeded over all available DNS-servers every time.
  An DNS-speed-test is done every 60 seconds and the DNS-server are sorted and used in the speed order - fastest first.
  The speed increase factor is nearly the number of defined (used) DNS-server, because for the majority of the
  DNS querys only the first DNS-Server was used (until now). So the DNS-server list was more a failoverlist
  and is now a realtimelist.

- The analyzer is now able to do realtime RWL and DNSBL (RBL) queries, if no Cache entries are found.


2012-08-19
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12232:

changed:

- On windows it now possible to suspend and to resume the spambox-service.
  On nix systems the same could be done by sending the signal 'NUM07' to the spambox process - to resume spambox to a the 
  normal state send the same signal again.

  The same actions are available in the GUI at the buttom the main page - button 'suspand/resume' .
  
  If the service/process is suspended, spambox is moved to the following state:
  
  - all SMTP- and Proxy- listeners are switched off - spambox accepts no new SMTP+Proxy connections
  - POP3 collection is stopped
  - all still processed connections are processed until they are finished (without damping)
  - still running tasks in the rebuild and Maint- thread will be normaly finished
  - no new scheduled tasks will be started
  - all threads are keeping the current database connections opened
  - the GUI is fully functional - and all tasks initiated from the GUI will be processes
  - the configuration sychronizing is only working in send mode - no changes will be received
  - the MainThread will be no longer monitored by the MaintThread
  - SNMP is fully functional


2012-08-18
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12231:

- If because of 'SPFlocalRecord' , 'SPFoverride' or 'LocalPolicySPF' a SPF-fail was detected - the thrown error
  was not correct handled and the SPF routine has returned OK.

changed:

- The analyzer gives some more information about the SPF results.
  

2012-08-17
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12230:

- calculating IPv6 addresses was partly done in upper case - the RFC recommendation is lower case - this is changed
- The configuration of 'SPFlocalRecord' , 'SPFoverride' and 'LocalPolicySPF' was not working after an upgrade
  of the module Mail::SPF to version 2.008

  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  Mail::SPF version 2.007 is required  
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  

changed:

- the rebuildspamdb log now contains some more information about possible errors and/or configuration mistakes

added:

- The DNSBL (RBL) and DNSWL (RWL) checks now allows to check IPv6 addresses. If the configured service providers allows
  the query of IPv6 addresses - SPAMBOX will act on there answers the same way like for IPv4 addresses.



2012-08-16
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12229:

- There was the following change in 2.2.1 build 12220 (2012-08-07)
...
  Leading DOT's are now replaced with '%2E' in each line of the report mail.
...
  The '%2E' was not correct handled by some mail clients -> the replacement for the leading DOT's
  is change to MIME-Quoted-Printable '=2E' 

- some no longer required code parts are removed
- code improvement for skipping checks
- centralized UTF-8 encoding and decoding


2012-08-15
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12228:

changed:

- If the receive of mail data takes longer than 'smtpIdleTimeOut' (or 180 seconds if not set) and all the data 
  are queued for the final Plugin-, charset conversion- or DKIM- processing - spambox sends a simple header line

X-SPAMBOX-KEEP:[CR][LF]

  to the server and resets this special internal timer. So your MTA should get every 180 seconds this line in the 
  DATA part of the mail as long as SPAMBOX receives the slow large DATA, to keep the connection alife.
  This is done to prevent SMTP-timeouts for the MTA connection.


added:

- The GUI now has a 'Print Config/Screen' link at the very bottom of all pages.
  In the Main-Config view it will expand all topics, print the config like a manual and collaps all topics. 
  In all other pages, the screen will be printed. 



2012-08-14
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12227:

added:

'EmailAdminDomains','Restrict Email Admins to Domains*',
  Use this parameter to restrict users registered in EmailAdmins, EmailAdminReportsTo and EmailBlockTo to a 
  list of domains or users, for which they can request BlockReports.
  It is possible to use defined GROUPS and the file: option is required. Use the following syntax to define 
  an entry (one per line):
  EmailAdminAddress=>*@domain1,*@domain2 user@domain3 ...
  [user@domain]=>*@domain1,*@domain2 user@domain3 ...
  Wildcards are allowed to be used in the domain definition - like *@*.domain.tld - separate multiple domains 
  by comma or space.
  If a BlockReport is requested for a not allowed email address, the complete BlockReport request will be ignored.
  If an EmailAdmins address is not registered in this parameter, he/she is able to request BlockReports for all domains.




2012-08-13
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12226:

added:

- There is a new GUI option beside 'manage users' / 
'change password', which allows an user to switch between the full GUI and a mobile version of the GUI.

The mobile GUI version reduces the unzipped HTML data from ~3.0 MB to ~1MB . 
The follwing is changed in the mobile version to the full version:

- no alpha index
- no config options are shown in the left menu, which is switched off per default
- no floating of the left menu
- reduced help text is shown (only the first line is shown)


SPAMBOX should be able to detect every mobile device browser - if such a 
browser is detected, SPAMBOX uses the mobile view as default.
The 'autodetect' is switched of, if a user has selected any of the both 
versions inside the opened session using the link at least one time.

To force SPAMBOX to use any of the both version at the startup of the HTTP 
session, define '?mobile=x' in the URL - like:

http://your_host:55555?mobile=1
http://your_host:55555?mobile=0

this will also switch off the 'autodetection'.




2012-08-08
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12221:

- Because of the changes to the BlockReport in build 12220, the HTML part of the report has shown only
  1 and 2 digits.
  
   

2012-08-07
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12220:

- The statistc CPU usage information was only calculated for the MainThread (0) 
  the 'Infos and Stats' screen now has a popup at the text column 'CPU usage', which shows the CPU usage for
  every worker.
  
- If the Perl module Unicode::GCString was installed and enabled in the configuration, under rare conditions
  the Perl process was crashing with SEGVAULT or a memory access violation.
  In most cases this was happen in the rebuildspamdb processing.
  The data are now checked and if possible converted to UTF-8 to be 100% Unicode compatible, 
  before they are passed to this module.
  In case there is left any doubt about the Unicode conformity of the data, the UAX #29 Grapheme Clusters detection
  is scipped.
     
- The BlockReport resend function was some times not working, if the MTA or the mail client have (wrong) removed
  leading DOT's from each line of the HTML parts of the report mail.
  Leading DOT's are now replaced with '%2E' in each line of the report mail.
   


2012-08-05
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12218:


- 'noScanIP' was not working

- an new SPAMBOX_AFC version 2.05 is relased to fix the 'noScanIP' problem for the plugin



2012-08-04
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12217:

- the description of EnableBangPath was not correct - it is changed to describe the code function
'EnableBangPath','Support Bang Path'
'If set, SPAMBOX will support addresses like domainx!user and will convert them to user@domainx .'

- the SPF check has produced dynamic scoring Stats - they are removed now


- the scoring Stat 'SSL/TLS-connection-OK' caused an error in MRTG - the value is changed to 'SSL-TLS-connection-OK'

- if an explicit defintion for any MessageSize value was set to 'nolimit (0)' like '@anydomain=>0', the second check
  was wrong failing
  
- the corpus confidence was not shared between multiple spambox instances  

- because of a bug in a central match-check routine, it was possible that scoring results were wrong calculated
  and several other matching result were wrong and caused unexpected blocking/nonblocking results


changed:

- the following SMTP commands and offers are now also removed by spambox

UTF8REPLY
UTF8SMTP
UTF8SMTPA
UTF8SMTPS
UTF8SMTPAS

UTF8LMTP
UTF8LMTPA
UTF8LMTPS
UTF8LMTPAS



- if the 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table' returns a value of zero an addiationaly check for 600 records is done
  and an error message is written to the log, if the database contains any record




2012-08-02
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12215:

- new 'spambox-mrtg.cfg' and SPAMBOX-MIB corrects some scrambled OID's

- some SNMP OID's were wrong mapped in spambox.pl

- removing PersonalBlackDb entries via email interface could lead in to stucking
  workers


2012-08-01
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12214:

- The scoring statisic is no longer dynamicaly build -> so it could be stated via SNMP.

- An new 'spambox-mrtg.cfg' MRTG example file is published and required for this build and higher if you want to
  stat spambox via MRTG-SNMP.

- An new file SPAMBOX-MIB is published - it is required for MRTG-SNMP-Stats and if spambox will be configured via SNMP.
  Notice that some of the OID's has been changed - crosscheck your SNMP application configuration against the new 
  MIB file if you work with OID's, SNMP-OID-Names are not changed.   
  


2012-07-31
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12213:

- If 'HMMusesBDB' was set and 'useDB4IntCache' was not set, the HMMdb was cleanedup at the next start of spambox.

- the new SPAMBOX_AFC plugin 2.04 fixes a small sorting problem which caused some times a wrong blocking/notblocking for the message size


changed:

- The PersonalBlack list now processes also wildcarded TO - parts like anylocaldomain,@anylocaldomain or *@anylocaldomain 
  notice that those entries could not be added, removed or modified using the email interface - you must use the GUI
  or edit the database table otherwise.
  Those entries are usefull to block an external domain for one complete local domain.
  Keep in mind, that the local user will possibly not get informed about blocked mails, if such an entry was the reason
  for the blocking behavior!


- the 'General Runtime Information' section of the 'Infos and Stats' screen shows now the average blocking<=>nonblocking
  correctness - this value is calculated assuming that every third false positive/negative email is reported to spambox

added:

- The 'Infos and Stats' screen now contains a section for a scoring statistic.
  Shown is the number of scored messages for each scored check (the list is dynamic).
  Notice that checks, that are scored with a zero value (...ValencePB:=0) are not stated.



2012-07-29
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12211:

- the index was not working like expected in the 'manage user' dialog in every case

- the Firebird ODBC driver was not supported

- if the creation of the HMM database has failed, the HMM check was not enabled again if the next
  HMM database creation was successful



2012-07-26
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12208:

- if two or more mails were transfered inside the same connection and any message was detected to be
  not copied to a spam or ham account, all following mails were also not copied

- the bounce report inside the rebuildspamdb report was not working like expected

- it was possible that rarely some 'noprocessing' mails were collected ,even if 'noProcessingLog' was set to 'nocollect'


changed:

The description of DoBayesian is changed (enhanced functions are available)

...
Both, the Bayesian-check and the Hidden-Makrov-Model-check (below), are using Perl version depending 
(Perl 5.12 and higher) Unicode features to recognize any possible character. How ever, some east asian 
languages (and some others) have graphemes, that contains multiple unicode code points. 
If you need (or want) spambox to process all text as a sequence of UAX #29 Grapheme Clusters, the Perl module 
Unicode::LineBreak is required.
 

- the connection status screen is enhanced
  It was not possible to calculate or to see the real mail processing time if damping was enabled,
  the real avg. processing time is now shown is this screen

- the performance of the unicode word processing is enhanced


added:

- a new hidden variable 'Unidecode2Console' is available
If set to '1' (ON) and the module Text::Unidecode is installed - all NONASCII characters of all
languages written to the console are converted to ASCII characters (or combinations) 

our $Unidecode2Console = 0;  # (0/1) use Text::Unidecode to decode NONASCII characters to ASCII - if available  
                                if set - 'ConsoleCharset' is ignored

'EnableHighPerformance','Enable Higher Performance','0:off|3000:slightly|1000:medium|500:high|10:very high',
 If set, the SMTP-Worker-Threads will get new pending connections much faster - using less wait states. 
 The speed to interrupt the workers by the MainThread is increased. Using this feature will increase the 
 CPU usage of the system!



2012-07-20
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12202:

- it was possible that building the 'WhiteOrg' hash from the Senderbase-Cache has taken very long at
  an spambox startup (if the SB-Cache was very large or the DB was slow) - 
  this will be possibly happen one more time after upgrading to this version

- it was possible to see stucking workers (in Senderbase Check) because of too many concurrent updates to the database


changed:

- if 'debug' or 'DataBaseDebug' is set to 'ON' a debug file is written to 'debug/sql_import...txt', which
  contains all SQL statements used to import a database

- the Senderbase-Cache is changed - it contains now much less records - all in CIDR notation


added:

- The Perl module update procedure now writes a logfile in 'notes/upgraded_Perl_Modules.log



2012-07-14
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12196:

- SPAMBOX is now able to handle the different and buggy versions of Win32::Unicode
  all version from 0.33 to 0.36 will be ignored and all unicode features will be disabled
  
changed:

- The Firebird is now supported (not recommended) by spambox. To use this database, the new released
  file spambox_db_import.cfg has to be used or the following line must be added to this file!

Firebird|*|NOOP|NOOP|$sql_sm="execute block as begin UPDATE OR INSERT INTO $mysqlTable VALUES "|
$sql_sm="($k,$v,0);"|$sql_sm="UPDATE OR INSERT INTO $mysqlTable VALUES "|80|$sql_sm=" end"
  
   


2012-07-05
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12187:

- it was possible that the SPAMBOX_ARC plugin has thown errors about a missing sub 'Win32::Unicode::File::flush' after
  an upgrade to the latest Compress::Zlib perl package
  
- the sub 'SPAMBOX::Senderbase::Query::inet_ntoa' was missing



changed:

the default value of the hidden configuration variable 'lockDatabases' has been changed from 1 to 0
# (0/1) - locks databases on access in every worker to prevent access violation




2012-06-22
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12176:

- an incomplete or wrong schedule definition caused an exception about a wrong defined variable

changed:

- changing 'NumComWorkers' now requires a restart in every case



2012-06-22
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12174:

- spambox some times dies with '....lock can only be used on a shared variable'
- both blockreport resend links are not working in some cases
- the result line is wrong, if an email address is added to whitelist via GUI-address-action
- some scheduled tasks are not working correctly - and could cause unexpected crashes


changed:

- EmailBlockReportDomain requires now a leading '@'
- SMTP command replys without valid data (eg. new line only) are now skipped



2012-06-17
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12169:

- the penalty box scoring was not working for bad attachments
- the spambox restart sequence was stucking if the stop sequence of the MaintThread was hanging for any reason

changed:

- a new SPAMBOX_MIB file is released
- SPAMBOX_AFC.pm plugin version 2.02 is released
- the priority of the ChangeConfigSchedule is increased

added:

'UserAttach','User based Good and Bad Attachments*','This set of regular expression is used to identify attachments 
  that should be allowed or blocked for specified users and/or domains. Separate entries with a any of 
  '=>; , ; : space'. Separate multiple regex entries with pipe '|'. The dot . is assumed to precede the regex, 
  so don't include it anywhere (except the user name).
  To define entries you have to use the 'file:...' option. Define one entry per line - comments are not allowed 
  in a definition line.
  The syntax of an entry is as follows:
  username => good => goodAttachRegex , good-out => goodoutRegex , good-in => goodinRegex , block => blockAttachRegex , block-out => blockoutRegex , block-in => blockinRegex
  
  username - Mail solely to or from any of these addresses. Accepts specific addresses (user@domain.com), 
  user parts (user) or entire domains (@domain.com) or a Group definition [GROUP]. Wildcards are supported 
  (fribo*@domain.com).
  
  good => goodAttachRegex - good attachment for incoming and outgoing mails
  good-out => goodoutRegex - good attachment for outgoing mails
  good-in => goodinRegex - good attachment for incoming mails
  block => blockAttachRegex - bad attachment for incoming and outgoing mails
  block-out => blockoutRegex - bad attachment for outgoing mails
  block-in => blockinRegex - bad attachment for incoming mails
  
  For example:
  user@domain.tld => good => ai|asc|bhx|dat|doc|eps|gif|htm|html|ics|jpg|jpeg|hqx|od[tsp]|pdf|ppt|rar|rpt|rtf|snp|txt|xls|zip
  *@domain.tld => good => ai|asc|bhx , good-out => eps|gif , good-in => htm|html , block => pdf|ppt , block-out => rar|rpt , block-in => xls
  At least one of the above option must be defined in a line - a maximum of all (six) could be defined, if this makes sense.
  If the user name matches for a sender or recipient and a (in/out) regex definition is found in this file, 
  all level definition are overwritten for this mail.
  good, good-out and good-in - and also - block, block-out and block-in - will be logical OR combined according 
  to the mail flow.
  Notice: if a bad attachment is found on a user based attachment check, the penalty box IP address scoring is scipped.'



2012-06-16
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12168:

- it was not possible to define more than one value for 'myNameAlso'
- in some cases a wrong domain name was shown if a black domain was found
- workers were restarted or spambox was dieing if the same mail from the same IP was delivered in two or more
  different threads at exactly the same time



changed:

- a new SPAMBOX_MIB file is released


added:

a new hidden config variable is implemented:

$lockDatabases = 1; # (0/1) - locks databases on access in every worker to prevent access violation

Set this value to zero if you run in to performance problems - because workers are waiting too long for database answers.


'ConfigChangeSchedule','Schedule Configuration Changes*',
 'Use this option to schedule configuration changes. You must use the file option like 'file:files/configchangeschedule.txt' 
 to define schedules - an empty value disables this feature.
 Define one schedule per line - comments are not allowed in a schedule definition line!
 The line has to start with the schedule string ( see ReStartSchedule ) followed by the variable (or hidden variable ) 
 name to change, followed by ':=', followed by the value to change the variable to - like:
 
 8 0 * * * myNameAlso:=otherhost1.mydomain.tld
 0 6 * * *|0 10 * * * myNameAlso:=otherhost2.mydomain.tld
 0 1 * * * debug:=1
 0 2 * * * debug:=
 
 The schedule string can contain multiple schedule definitions separated by pipe'|'. You will get errors if:
 - the schedule definiton is wrong
 - the variable name is wrong (does not exists)
 - the syntax of the value is wrong
 Notice - spambox will only check the syntax at definition time - the logical correctness of the value will be checked 
 at the scheduled time! So, spambox will (for example) not check any dependencies at definition time - if a dependency 
 is wrong, the change request at the scheduled time will fail!
 Notice - all configuration changes are done with 'root' permission! For this reason, this configuration parameter 
 is only visable to root and it is stored encrypted!
 
 For advanced users ONLY:
 Using the following extension, requires a deep internal knowledge of the spambox code!
 It is also possible to schedule a call to an internal spambox subroutine. The name of the subroutine has to begin with a '&',
 the parameters that should passed to the subroutine must be in '()' - like:
 0 6 * * * &subname(var1,var2,..,...)
 0 7 * * * &subname()
 Notice: the subroutine will be called in the MainThread and syntax check will be done at run time - 
 possible errors are shown in the log!'



2012.06-02
new SPAMBOX_AFC Plugin version 2.01

added:

'SPAMBOX_AFCWebScript','Script to move large attachments to a web server',
 'If the size of an undecoded attachment exceeds the SPAMBOX_AFCinsize or SPAMBOX_AFCoutsize parameter, 
  spambox will call this script and will replace the attachment with the text returned by this script or executable.
  If no text is returned by the script (a warning is written to the maillog.txt) or the returned text begins with 
  the word "error", the attachment will not be replaced.
  The script has to write the resulting text or error to STDOUT.
  The resulting text could be any of plain text or html code. The MIME-enconding and the Content-Type value of 
  the resulting MIME-part will be set accordingly.
  The text should contain the link to download the attachment, possibly some explanation (eg. download life time), 
  web login information or a web-session-identifier - what ever is needed to fit the requirements of your web server.
  You have to define the full path to the script and all parameters that should be pass to the script. 
  The literal FILENAME will be replaced with the attachment filename (including the full path) that was stored 
  in the /transfer folder. Any literal starting with an '$', will be replaced by the according connection hash value 
  or the global variable with the name.
  
  for example:
  $relayok will be replaced by $Con->{relayok} - which identifies if it is an incoming (1) or outgoing/local (0) mail
  
  So a possible definition of this parameter could be: 
  '/usr/bin/move_attachment_to_web.sh $relayok FILENAME' 
  or 
  'c:/spambox/move_attachment_to_web.cmd $relayok FILENAME'
  
  The file has to be removed by the script. If not, spambox will warn about this and will remove the file in the /transfer 
  folder.
  To keep the filenames unique, the spambox message identifier is placed in front of the filename - 
  like: M1-30438-02027_attachmentfilename. Notice: if the filename contains unicode characters, 
  spambox will pass this characters in UTF-8 to your script!
  Keep in mind, that if this script terminates it's own process - SPAMBOX will die!
 
'SPAMBOX_AFCinsize','Attachment size incoming'
 'The size in KB of an attachment in incoming mails that must be reached, to call the SPAMBOX_AFCWebScript. 
 This parameter is ignored if left blank or set to zero.'
'SPAMBOX_AFCoutsize','Attachment size outgoing/local'
 'The size in KB of an attachment in outgoing or local mails that must be reached, to call the SPAMBOX_AFCWebScript. 
 This parameter is ignored if left blank or set to zero.'



2012-05-30
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12151:

- the rebuildspamdb speed was reduced too much in build 12150


2012-05-29
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12150:

- using BerkeleyDB cause an error message 'Undefined subroutine main::BDB_Filter'
- workers were restarted or spambox was dieing if the same mail from the same IP was delivered in two or more
  different threads at exactly the same time


changed:

the following SMTP extension are now filtered out by spambox (in addition)

8bitmime
BINARYMIME
BDAT
AUTH GSSAPI
AUTH NTLM
X-LINK2STATE

- the Senderbase check now registers all CIDR addresses in the SBCache only if 'pbdb' is set to 'DB:'
  (a database is used for the Penaltybox)
  
- the automatic Perl module update is only done at startup, if the last update is at least 12 hours ago

- a new SPAMBOX_MIB file is released for build 12150


added:

'SSL_version','SSL version used for transmission'
  'Sets the version of the SSL protocol used to transmit data. The default is SSLv2/3,
  which auto-negotiates between SSLv2 and SSLv3. You may specify 'SSLv2', 'SSLv3', or 'TLSv1' (case-insensitive) 
  if you do not want this behavior.'

'SSL_cipher_list','SSL key cipher list',
 'If this option is set the cipher list for the connection will be set to the given value, e.g. something like 
 'ALL:!LOW:!EXP:!ADH'. Look into the OpenSSL documentation (<http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER_STRINGS>) 
 for more details.
 If this option is not used (default) the openssl builtin default is used which is suitable for most cases.'



2012-05-28
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12149:

- remove an IP address from SBCache was not working in the GUI address management
- the WhiteOrgList was not filled up correctly at startup

changed:

- the Senderbase check now registers all CIDR addresses in the SBCache
- improved Senderbase DNS queries
- improved internal thread timeline handling



2012-05-24
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12145:

- workers were restarted or spambox was dieing if the same mail from the same IP was delivered in two or more
  different threads at exactly the same time
  because it is really difficult to reproduce this mistake - this is the first try to solve this problem
  For those of you, who gets attacked by spammers with such mails - there is a hardcoded workaround available.
  
  $delaySameIPorHelo = 0; # number > 0 - prevents accessing same storage for identical connections at the same time

  To prevent spambox from dieing on this problem, set this variable at the commandline or in the module 
  CorrectSPAMBOXcfg.pm to a value of between 2 and 5. Indentical IP's and/or HELO's will be delayed in processing for 
  this number of seconds.
  Notice that this workaround could (will) be removed at any time, if this issue is no longer reported.
  
- the internal handling of the DNS query handling is improved

- the import of the Spamdb and/or HMMdb from the rebuildspamdb thread (10001) has shown a wrong remaining time
  in the log
    
- it was possible that some SSL handshake has failed because of an unavailable 'ciffer' in one peer
  SPAMBOX now supports all in the OpenSSL available ciffers. Updating OpenSSL could help to prevent or to solve this
  problem.



2012-05-16
fixed in spambox 2.2.1 build 12137:

- the HMM database was reported as empty, if 'HMMusesBDB' was set to ON and DBdriver was not set to 'BerkeleyDB'
- if 'HMMusesBDB' was set to ON, the SMTP workers have not got the signal that the HMMdb was published successfully 
  until spambox was restarted
- because of a BUG in the module Net::SMTP::TLS the configuration synchronization feature failed with 'wrong SSL_version', 
  if SSL was enabled - spambox replaces the buggy Net::SMTP::TLS subroutine
