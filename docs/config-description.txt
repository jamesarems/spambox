# Network Setup  #
listenPort: SMTP Listen Port --  The port number on which ASSP will listen for incoming SMTP connections (normally 25). You can specify both an IP address and port number to limit connections to a specific interface.Examples: 25, 127.0.0.1:25, 127.0.0.1:25|127.0.0.2:25  default: 25  
smtpDestination: SMTP Destination --  The IP address! and port number of your primary SMTP. If multiple servers are listed and the first listed MTA does not respond, each additional MTA will be tried. If only a port number is entered, or the dynamic keyword INBOUND is used with a port number, then the connection will be established to the local IP address on which the connection was received. This is useful when you have several IP addresses with different domains or profiles in your MTA. If INBOUND:PORT is used, ReportingReplies (Analyze,Help,etc and CopyMail will go to 127.0.0.1:PORT. If your needs are different, use  (Copy Spam )Examples:127.0.0.1:125, [::1]:125, 127.0.0.1:125|127.0.0.5:125 default: 125  
enableSSL: Enable SSL support --  For SSL to be enabled, check this box and enter the paths to your SSL Certificate and SSL Key files, below.
  NOTE: Changing this requires a restart of ASSP.   
listenPortSSL: SMTP Secure Listen Port --  The port number on which ASSP will listen for incoming secure SMTP connections (normally 465). You can specify both an IP address and port number to limit connections to a specific interface. 
Examples: 465, 127.0.0.1:465, 127.0.0.1:465|127.0.0.2:465    
SSLCertFile: SSL Certificate File (PEM format) --  Full path to the file containing the server's SSL certificate, for example : /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/assp-cert.pem.   
SSLKeyFile: SSL Key File (PEM format) --  Full path to the file containing the server's SSL key, for example: /usr/local/etc/ssl/certs/assp-key.pem.   
listenPort2: Second SMTP Listen Port --  A secondary port number on which ASSP can accept SMTP connections. This is useful as a dedicated port for VPN clients or for those who cannot directly send mail to a mail server outside of their ISP's network because the ISP is blocking port 25. You may also specify an IP address to limit connections to a specific interface.Examples: 587, 127.0.0.1:587, 192.168.0.100:587   
smtpAuthServer: Second SMTP Destination --  The IP address! and port number to connect to when mail is received on the second SMTP listen port. If the field is blank, the primary SMTP destination will be used. The purpose of this setting is to allow remote users to make authenticated connections and transmit their email without encountering SPF failures.Examples:127.0.0.1:687, [::1]:687  
EnforceAuth: Force SMTP AUTH on Second SMTP Listen Port --  Force clients connecting to the second listen port to authenticate before transferring mail. To use this setting, both  (Second SMTP Destination) must be configured.  
enableINET6: Enable IPv6 support --  For IPv6 to be enabled, check this box. NOTE: Changing this requires a restart of ASSP.  
smtpDestinationRT: SMTP Destination Routing Table <a href="http://www.magicvillage.de/~Fritz_Borgstedt/assp/0002DF8F-8000001C/S06665A73?WasRead=1" target=wiki><img height=12 width=12 src="get?file=images/info.png" alt="Routing Table" /></a> --  If INBOUND is used in the SMTP Destination field, the rules specified here are used to route the inbound IP address to a different outbound IP address. You must specify a port number with the outbound IP address. This feature works by assigning as many IP's to  ASSP as you have different receiving Mailservers. This can be avoided by using the advanced flow we recommend: 
  Example:141.120.110.1=>141.120.110.129:25|141.120.110.2=>141.120.110.130:125|141.120.110.3=>141.120.110.130:125

  
# SMTP Session Limits  #
MaxErrors: Maximum Errors Per Session --  The maximum number of SMTP session errors encountered before the
connection is dropped. Scoring is done with . default: 5  
maxSMTPSessions: Maximum Sessions --  The maximum number of simultaneous SMTP sessions. This can prevent server overloading and DoS attacks. 64 simultaneous sessions are typically enough. No entry or zero means no limit. default: 64  
maxSMTPipSessions: Maximum Sessions Per IP Address --  The maximum number of SMTP sessions allowed per IP address. Use this setting to prevent server overloading and DoS attacks. 5 sessions are typically enough. If left blank or set to 0 there is no limit imposed by ASSP. . default: 5 
npSize: External Messages NoProcessing Size --  This limit ensures that only messages smaller than this limit are processed by ASSP. Most spam
isn't bigger than a few k. ASSP will treat incoming messages larger than this SIZE (in bytes) as 'No Processing' mail. Empty or 0 disables the feature. default: 256000  
npSizeLocal: Local Messages NoProcessing Size --  ASSP will treat local (outgoing) messages larger than  as 'No Processing' mail. default: 1 
HeaderMaxLength: Maximum Header Size --  The maximum allowed header length, in bytes. At each mail hop header information is added by the mail server. A large mail header can indicate a mail loop. If the value is blank or 0 the header size will not be checked. default: 50000  
maxRealSize: Max Real Size of Local Message --  If the value of (number of [rcpt to] * [message size]) exceeds  in bytes the transmission of the local message will be canceled. No limit is imposed by ASSP if the field is left blank or set to 0. This option allows admins to limit useless bandwidth wasting based on the total transmit size.  
maxRealSizeExternal: Max Real Size of External Message --  If the value of (number of [rcpt to] * [message size]) exceeds  in bytes the transmission of the external message will be canceled. No limit is imposed by ASSP if the field is left blank or set to 0. This option allows admins to limit useless bandwidth wasting based on the total transmit size.  
maxRealSizeError: Max Real Size Error Message --  SMTP error message to reject . default: 552 message exceeds MAXREALSIZE byte (size * rcpt)  
smtpIdleTimeout: SMTP Idle Timeout --  The number of seconds a session is allowed to be idle before being forcibly disconnected. The default is 180 seconds. No limit is imposed by ASSP if the field is left blank or set to 0. If you have not defined an IdleTimeout on your MTA, this value should not be set to 0, because then a connection will never be timed out! Scoring is done with toValencePB. default: 180 
CheckEarlyTalker: Check for Misbehaving SMTP session --   
smtpNOOPIdleTimeout: SMTP Idle Timeout after NOOP --  The number of seconds a session is allowed to be idle after a "NOOP" command is received, before being forcibly disconnected. The default is 0 seconds. No limit is imposed by ASSP if the field is left blank or set to 0.
  This should prevent hackers to hold and block connections by sending "NOOP" commands short before the "" is reached.   
smtpNOOPIdleTimeoutCount: SMTP Idle Timeout after NOOP Count --  The number of counts a session is allowed send "NOOP" commands following on each other, before being forcibly disconnected. The default is 0. No limit is imposed by ASSP if the field is left blank or set to 0.

spamSubject: Prepend Spam Subject  --  Setting a filter to testmode will tell ASSP not to reject the mail but rather build up the whitelist and spam and notspam collections. This can go on for some time without disturbing normal operation. After this very important phase TestMode can be used to tag the message: if TestMode and the message is spam Spam Subject gets prepended to the subject of the email. For example: [SPAM]   
spamTag: Prepend Spam Tag --  ASSP uses many methods. The method which caught the spam  will be prepended to the subject of the email. For example: [DNSBL]   
SpamError: Spam Error --  SMTP error message to reject spam. The literal LOCALDOMAIN will be replaced by the recipient domain. For example:554 5.7.1 Mail appears to be unsolicited -- send error reports to postmaster@LOCALDOMAIN. default: 554 5.7.1 Mail appears to be unsolicited -- send error reports to postmaster@LOCALDOMAIN  
send250OK: Send 250 OK  --  Set this checkbox if you want ASSP to reply with '250 OK' instead of SMTP error code '554 5.7.1'.

NoExternalSpamProb: Block Outgoing Spam-Prob header --  Check this box if you don't want your X-Assp-Spam-Prob header on external mail
 Note this means mail from local users to local users will also be missing the header. default: 1 
AddSpamHeader: Add Spam Header --  Adds a line to the email header "X-Assp-Spam: YES" if the message is spam. default: 1 
AddCustomHeader: Add Custom Header --  Adds a line to the email header if the message is spam. For example:  default: X-Spam-Status:yes  
AddLevelHeader: Add Graphical Level Header --  Adds a line to the email header "X-Assp-Spam-Level:**** " showing the totalscore represented by stars. default: 1 
AddSpamReasonHeader: Add Spam Reason Header --  Adds a line to the email header "X-Assp-Spam-Reason: " explaining why the message is spam. default: 1

spamLovers: All SpamLover* --   are lists of criteria that when matched will allow a SMTP session through ASSP's filter process, regardless of what blocking functions match and would otherwise cause the message to be rejected. However, there is an exception to this when there are multiple recipients that do not all match the criteria of the spam Lovers match. In this exception the message will be processed normally and will be subjected to all blocking criteria.
 This can be specified per filter or for all messages. Messages to SpamLovers are processed and filtered by ASSP, but get tagged with  will suppress this. Accepts specific addresses (user@example.com), user parts (user) or entire domains (@example.com).  Wildcards are supported (fribo*@example.com).

# No Processing #
noProcessingIPs: No Processing IPs* --  Mail from any of these IP's will pass through without processing. 
 For example: 127.0.0.1|172.16.   
noProcessing: No Processing Addresses* --  Mail solely to or from any of these addresses are proxied without processing. Like a more efficient version of SpamLovers and redlist combined. Accepts specific addresses (user@example.com), user parts (user) or entire domains (@example.com).  Wildcards are supported (fribo*@example.com).   
noProcessingFrom: No Processing Addresses From* --  Mail solely from any of these addresses are proxied without processing. Accepts specific addresses (user@example.com), user parts (user) or entire domains (@example.com).  Wildcards are supported (fribo*@example.com).  
noProcessingDomains: No Processing Domains* --  Domains from which you want to receive all mail and  proxy without processing. Your ISP, domain registration, mail list servers, stock broker, or other key business partners might be good candidates. Note this matches the end of the address, so if you don't want to match subdomains then include the @. Note that buy.com would also match spambuy.com but .buy.com won't match buy.com. For example: sourceforge.net|@google.com|.buy.com default: sourceforge.net  
npRe: Regular Expression to Identify No Processing Mail* --  If a message matches this Perl regular expression ASSP will treat the message as a 'No Processing' mail. For example: 169\.254\.122\.|172\.16\.|\[autoreply\].

Accepts specific addresses (user@example.com), user parts (user) or entire domains (@example.com).  Wildcards are supported (fribo*@example.com). Note that if an address matches both the NoProcessing and the OnlyTheseProcessing lists, the NoProcessing rules take precedence.  
poTestMode: Enable Process Only Addresses --    
# Whitelisting/Redlisting #
whiteListedIPs: Whitelisted IPs* --  They  contribute to the Whitelist and to Notspam. For example: 127.0.0.1|172.16.    
whiteRe: Regular Expression to Identify Non-Spam*  --  If an incoming email matches this Perl regular expression it will be considered non-spam.For example: Secret Ham Password|307\D{0,3}730\D{0,3}4[12]\d\dFor help writing regular expressions click .IMPORTANT: The body is scanned in a later stage  AFTER all sender related checks are performed. So a white regular expression here might not prevent the message from being blocked by eg. invalid PTR. Set the sender related checks to score only if you want to make sure that the white regular expression will be seen. Some things you might include here are your office phone number or street address, spam rarely includes these details.  .   
whiteListedDomains: Whitelisted Domains and Addresses* --  Domains and addresses from which you want to receive all mail. Your ISP, domain registration, mail list servers, stock broker, or other key business partners might be good candidates. Note this matches the end of the address, so if you don't want to match subdomains then include the @. Note that example.com would also match spamexample.com but .example.com won't match example.com. Wildcards are supported. For example: sourceforge.net|group*@google.com|.example.com default: sourceforge.net  
wildcardUser: Wildcard User for White Domain  --  If you add this user via email-interface(eg: *@example.com), the whole domain will be whitelisted. For example: '*' default: *  
WhitelistOnly: Reject All But Whitelisted Mail --  Check this if you don't want Bayesian filtering and want to reject all mail from anyone not whitelisted.  
NoAutoWhite: Only Email-Interface Addition to Whitelist. --  Check this box to  allow additions to the whitelist by  only.  
NotGreedyWhitelist: Only the envelope-sender is added/compared to the whitelist --  Normal operation includes addresses in the FROM, SENDER, REPLY-TO, ERRORS-TO, or LIST-* header fields.This allows nearly all list email to be whitelisted. Check this option to disable this. Will not do anything if you add/remove whitelist entries via email-interface   
WhitelistLocalOnly: Only local or authenticated users contribute to the whitelist. --  Normal operation allows all local, authenticated, or whitelisted users to contribute to the whitelist.Check this box to not allow whitelisted users to add to the whitelist.   
WhitelistLocalFromOnly: Only users with a local domain in mailfrom contribute to the whitelist. --  Check this box to prevent sender with non-local domains ( not in ) from contributing to the whitelist. (for example: redirected messages). default: 1 
WhitelistAuth: Whitelist authenticated users. --   
UpdateWhitelist: Save Whitelist --  Save a copy of the white list every this many seconds. Empty or Zero will prevent any saving.Note: the current timeout must expire before the new setting is loaded, or you can restart. default: 3600 
redRe: Regular Expression to Identify Redlisted Mail* --  If an email matches this Perl regular expression it will be 
considered redlisted.
The Redlist serves two purposes:
1) the Redlist is a list of addresses that cannot contribute to the 
whitelist, and which are not considered local, even if their mail is 
from a local computer. For example, if someone goes on a vacation and 
turns on their autoresponder, put them on the redlist until 
they return. Then as they reply to every spam they receive they won't 
corrupt your non-spam collection or whitelist: \[autoreply\]
2) Redlisted addresses will not be added to the Whitelist when your 
local user sends mail to that address, thereby preventing accidental 
pollution of the Whitelist by, say, inadvertent replies by your 
users to e-mails from the spammer.
Redlisted messages will not be stored in the 
SPAM/NOTSPAM-collection if  is set. 
As all fields marked by * this field accepts 
a list separated by | or a specified file 'file:files/redre.txt'. default: file:files/redre.txt 
ValidateRWL: Enable Realtime Whitelist Validation --  RWL: Real-time white list. These are lists of IP addresses that have
 somehow been verified to be from a known good host. Senders that pass RWL validation will pass IP-based filters. This requires an installed  module in PERL.  
RWLwhitelisting: Whitelist all RWL Validated Addresses --  If set, the message will pass also Bayesian Filter and URIBL.  
RWLServiceProvider: RWL Service Providers* --  Domain Names of RWLs to use separated by "|".Examples are:
 list.dnswl.org|cml.anti-spam.org.cn|iadb.isipp.com|hul.habeas.com  default: list.dnswl.org|cml.anti-spam.org.cn|query.bondedsender.org  
RWLmaxreplies: Maximum Replies --  A reply is affirmative or negative reply from a RWL. The RWL module will wait for this number of replies (negative or positive) from the RWLs listed under Service Provider for up to the Maximum Time below. This number should be equal to or less than the number of RWL Service Providers listed to allow for randomly unavailable RWLs. default: 3  
RWLminhits: Minimum Hits --  A hit is an affirmative response from a RWL. The RWL module will check all of the RWLs listed under Service Provider, and flag the email with a RWL pass flag if equal to or more than this number of RWLs return a postive whitelisted response. default: 1 
RWLmaxtime: Maximum Time --  This sets the maximum time to spend on each message performing RWL checks default: 5 
noRWL: Don't Validate RWL for these IPs* --  Enter IP addresses that you don't want to be RWL validated, separated by pipes (|). For example: 127.0.0.1|192.168. default:  127.0.0.|192.168.|10.  
AddRWLHeader: Add X-Assp-Received-RWL Header --  Add X-Assp-Received-RWL header to header of all emails processed by RWL. default: 1  
RWLCacheExp: RWL Cache Expiration Time --  IP's in cache will be removed after this interval in hours. 0 will disable the cache.   default: 72 
# Relaying  #
acceptAllMail: Accept All Mail* --  Relaying is allowed for these IPs. They  contribute also to the whitelist. This can take either a directly entered list of IP's separated by pipes or a file 'file:files/acceptall.txt'.For example: 127.0.0.1|172.16.   
localDomains: Local Domains* --  Check local domains against these addresses. As in every field marked by '*' separate addresses with | or use file 'file:files/localdomains.txt'. Wildcards are supported. For example: *example.com|*.example.com|example.org 
 The "Local Domains" are the  domain names that your mail
  system considers local. A MX record will usually point to ASSP for this domains.  Messages to "Local Domains" are also called "Incoming".
  Messages to domains not in "Local Domains" are also called "Outgoing".
  Messages from "Local Domains" are called "local" provided they come from IP's in  "Accept 		All Mail" (  ) or are authenticated,  otherwise they are called "external" or "remote".
  That a mail claims to be from one of your local domains does not
  allow it to be relayed -- this is easily spoofed and not useful as a
  security measure.
 
  If your clients dialup or are dynamically assigned from an untrusted
  pool, then the only reliable way to allow relaying is through
  AUTHENTICATED smtp, and your mail handler must support this type of
  authentication, and you must enable it in your clients. ASSP
  recognizes authenticated connections and allows them to relay.
 
  Not all ISPs will allow their customers to connect to your SMTP
  port. Many block connections to port 25 (except to their own mail
  server) to prevent spam. ASSP therefore provides a "Second SMTP Listen Port" (  ).  
 Use the syntax: *mydomain.com=>smtp.mydomain.com|other.com=>mx.other.com:port to verify the recipient addresses with the SMTP-VRFY  (if VRFY is not supported 'MAIL FROM:' and 'RCPT TO:' will be used)  command on other SMTP servers. The entry behind => must be the hostname:port or ip-address:port of the MTA which is used to verify 'RCPT TO' addresses with a VRFY command! If :port is not defined, port :25 will be used. You have to enable the SMTP 'VRFY' command on your MTA - the 'EXPN' command should be enabled! This requires an installed  module in PERL. 
 If you have configured LDAP and enabled  and ASSP finds a VRFY entry for a domain, LDAP search will be done first and if this fails, the VRFY will be used. So VRFY could be used for LDAP backup/fallback/failover!
 If you have configured  ) if the VRFY is successful.
 It is recommended to configure . default: putYourDomains.com|here.org  
DoLocalSenderDomain: Do Local Domain Check for Local Sender --  If activated, each local sender address must have a valid Local Domain in .  
DoLocalSenderAddress: Do Local Address Check for Local Sender --  If activated, each local sender must have a valid Local Address.  
LocalSender2NULL: Move Local Connection with wrong Sender Address to NULL --  If set, ASSP will move all Local connections where the sender failed  to a NULL-connection. The sender will receive "250 OK". default: 1 
nolocalDomains: Skip Local Domain Check --  Do not check relaying based on  has been filled. default: 1  
ldLDAP: Do LDAP Lookup for Local Domains --  Check local domains against an LDAP database.Note: Checking this requires filling in LDAP DomainFilter in The LDAP section.This requires an installed  module in Perl.  
ispip: ISP/Secondary MX Servers* --  Enter any addresses that are your ISP or backup MX servers, separated by pipes (|). These addresses will (necessarily) bypass Griplist, IP Limiting, Delaying, PenaltyBox, SPF, DNSBL and SRS checks unless the IP can be determined by  (ISP Connecting IP). For example: 145.145.145.145|145.145.145.146.   
contentOnlyRe: Regular Expression to Identify Forwarded Messages* --  Put anything here to identify messages which should bypass PB, Sender Validation, Griplist, IP Limiting, Delaying, SPF, DNSBL and SRS checks. For example:  email addresses of people who are forwarding from other accounts to their mailbox on your server.   
ispHostnames: Regular Expression to Identify ISP/Secondary Hostnames* --  Hostname(s) to lookup IP(s) connecting to the ISP/Secondary server.If found, the connecting IP is used to perform IP checks on routed messages.

# Delaying/Greylisting  #
EnableDelaying: Enable Delaying/Greylisting --  Enable Greylisting as described at .
   Greylisting involves sending a temporary 451 SMTP error code to the sending server when a message is received, along with sending this error code ASSP creates a Triplet and stores this. On the second delivery attempt if the Embargo Time set by the ASSP admin for the Triplet has been surpassed the message will be accepted and a Tuplet will be created and not delayed again for an Expiry Time set by the ASSP admin. default: 1 
DelayGripvalue: Do Greylisting/Delaying above this Gripvalue --  This can be used to restrict delaying to IPs with a higher Griplistvalue. The Griplistvalue is assigned to an IP-block between  0 and 1, where 0 = never spam and 1 = always spam. For examle 0.1. You may set it higher to 0.3 if you want to delay only IPs with a higher probality to send Spam. default: 0.1 
DelayWL: Whitelisted Greylisting --  Enable Greylisting for whitelisted users.  
DelayNP: NoProcessing Greylisting --  Enable Greylisting for noprocessing users.  
DelaySL: SpamLovers Greylisting --  Enable Greylisting for SpamLovers.  
DelaySSL: SSL Greylisting --  Enable Greylisting for SSL Connections. default: 1 
DelaySPF: SPF Pass Greylisting --  Enable Greylisting for SPF=pass results. default: 1 
DelayAddHeader: Add X-Assp-Delayed Header --  Add X-Assp-Delayed header to header of all delayed emails. default: 1 
DelayEmbargoTime: Embargo Time --  Enter the number of minutes for which delivery, related with new 'triplet' (IP address of the sending
  host + mail from + rcpt to), is refused with a temporary failure. Default is 5 minutes. default: 5  
DelayWaitTime: Wait Time --  Enter the number of hours to wait for delivery attempts related with recognised 'triplet'; delivery is accepted 
  immediately and the 'tuplet' (IP address of the sending host + sender's domain) is safelisted. Default is 28 hours. default: 28  
DelayExpiryTime: Expiry Time --  Enter the number of days for which whitelisted 'tuplet' is considered valid. Default is 36 days. default: 36  
DelayUseNetblocks: Use IP Netblocks --  Perform the IP address checks of the sending host based on the /24 subnet it is at rather than the specific IP. 
  This feature may be useful for legitimate mail systems that shuffle messages among SMTP clients between retransmissions. default: 1 
DelayNormalizeVERPs: Normalize VERP Addresses --  Some mailing lists (such as Ezmlm) try to track bounces to individual mails, rather than just individual recipients, which creates a variation on the VERP method where each email has it's own unique envelope sender. Since the automatic whitelisting (called savelisting to make a difference to the standard whitelisting) that is built into Greylisting depends on the envelope addresses for subsequent emails being the same, the greylisting filter will attempt to normalize the unique sender addresses, when this option is checked. default: 1 
DelayMD5: Use MD5 for DelayDB --  Message-Digest algorithm 5 is a cryptographic hash function and adds some level of security to the delay database. Must be set to off if you want to list the database with DelayShowDB/DelayShowDBwhite. default: 1  
DelayShowDB: Show Delay/Greylisting Database --  The directory/file with the delay database file. If you change  in section Filepath you must change it here too. default: file:delaydb 
DelayShowDBwhite: Show Delay/Greylisting Save Database --  The directory/file with the save delay database file. If you change  in section Filepath you must change it here too. default: file:delaydb.white 
DelayExpireOnSpam: Expire Spamming Safelisted Tuplets --  If a safelisted 'tuplet' is ever associated with spam, viri, failed rbl, spf etc, it is deleted from the safelist. 
  This renews the temporary embargo for subsequent mail involving the tuplet. default: 1 
CleanDelayDBInterval: Clean Up Delaying Database --  Delete outdated entries from triplets and safelisted tuplets databases every this many seconds.
  Note: the current timeout must expire before the new setting is loaded, or you can restart.
  Defaults to 3 hours. default: 10800  
noDelay: Don't Delay these IPs* --  Enter IP addresses that you don't want to be delayed, separated by pipes (|). There are misbehaving MTAs that will not be able to get a legitimate email through a Greylisting server because they do not try again later. For example 'file:files/nodelay.txt.txt').
  For example:  145.145.145.145|145.146. default: file:files/nodelay.txt 
DelayError: Reply Code to Refuse Delayed Messages --  SMTP reply code to refuse delayed messages. Default: 451 4.7.1 Please try again later
  
  
   default: 451 4.7.1 Please try again later

pass:The client IP address is an authorized mailer for the sender. The mail should be accepted subject to local policy regarding the sender.
fail:The client IP address is not an authorized mailer, and the sender wants you to reject the transaction for fear of forgery.
softfail:The client IP address is not an authorized mailer, but the sender prefers that you accept the transaction because it isn't absolutely sure all its users are mailing through approved servers. The softfail status is often used during initial deployment of SPF records by a domain.
neutral:The sender makes no assertion about the status of the client IP.
none:There is no SPF record for this domain.
permerror&temperror:The DNS lookup encountered an error during processing.
unknown:The domain has a configuration error in the published data or defines a mechanism that this library does not understand.

SPFnone: Fail SPF None  Responses --  Intentionally fail SPF 'none'  status responses  
SPFunknown: Fail SPF Unknown  Responses --  Intentionally fail SPF 'unknown'  status responses  
SPFCacheExp: SPF Cache Refresh Interval --  SPF records in cache will be removed after this interval in hours. 0 will disable the cache.   default: 72 
DebugSPF: Enable SPF Debug output to ASSP Logfile --  Enables verbose debugging of SPF queries within the Mail::SPF::Query module.
 
 
   
EnableSRS: Enable Sender Rewriting Scheme --  Enable Sender Rewriting Scheme as described at .
  This requires an installed  module in PERL.
  You should use SRS if your message handling system forwards email for domains with published spf records.
  Note that you have to setup the outgoing path (Relay Host and Port) to let ASSP see and rewrite your outgoing traffic. Testmode is set with .  
SRSAliasDomain: Alias Domain --  SPF requires the SMTP client IP to match the envelope sender (return-path). When a message is forwarded through
  an intermediate server, that intermediate server may need to rewrite the return-path to remain SPF compliant.
  For example: example.com default: example.com  
SRSSecretKey: Secret Key --  A key for the cryptographic algorithms -- Must be at least 5 characters long.

FileScanCMD: File Scan Command --  ASSP will call this system command and expects a returned string 
from this command. This returned string is checked against 
'' to detect if the message is 
OK or not! If the file does not exists after the command call, the 
message is consider infected. ASSP expects, that the file scan is 
finished when the command returns!
   The literal 'FILENAME' will be replaced by the full qualified

this field! In this case  are ignored. If 
there is a need to wait some time for the autoprotect scanner, write 
'NORUN-dddd', where dddd are the milliseconds to wait!
   Depending on your operating system it may possible that you have to 
quote (' or ") the command, if it contains whitespaces. The replaced 
file name will be quoted by ASSP if needed.  
FileScanBad: RegEx to Detect 'BAD' in Returned 
String* --  Put anything here to identify bad messages by the string returned

 QueryAddress=>ReportRecipient=>ReportDays  -  there are many possible combinations of this three parameters. For example:
 user@domain and user@domain=>user@domain - will send a report for this user to this user
 *@domain (better use) *@domain=>* - will send a report for every blocked user in this domain to this user
 user@domain=>recipient@any-domain - will send a report for user@domain to recipient@any-domain
 *@domain=>recipient@any-domain - will send a report for every blocked user in this domain to recipient@any-domain
 A third parameter is possible to set, which defines the number of days for which the report should be created. The default (if empty or not defined) is one day. This value is used to calculate the 'next run date'. For example:
 *@domain=>recipient@any-domain=>2 - creates a report for two days.
 *@domain=>*=>14 - creates a report for 14 days.
 user@domain=>=>3 or user@domain=>*=>3 - creates a report for three days. The second parameter is here empty or *!
