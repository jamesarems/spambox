The standards define port 25 to be plaintext.  The server can
offer "STARTTLS" and if the client uses that verb, the connection
is converted to TLS/SSL.  This port is intended for MTA-to-MTA and
for older local clients.
Port 465 used to be defined as TLS/SSL from the start, but this is
now deprecated.  You should avoid using 465 if you don\'t need it; it
is there if you have older clients that only know about this port and
can\'t be reconfigured.
Port 587 is defined also as plaintext with a STARTTLS possibility.
Port 587 is often configured to require client AUTH.  You probably
want this port for your local clients, but 25 is ok too.
Ports 25 and 587 are more-or-less equivalent.  At some sites they
are exactly equivalent.  If the server offers them, both can support
AUTH and both can support STARTTLS.  The difference is only in that
port 587 is intended to require use of AUTH, wheras on 25 AUTH is
optional.



Simple Workflow

* Inbound
Internet -> SPAMBOX -> Mailserver -> User

* Outbound
User -> SPAMBOX -> Mailserver -> Internet


Advanced Workflow 
- recommended for installations with considerable number of users 
- necessary for MS Exchange & similar workgroup server

* Inbound
Internet -> SPAMBOX -> SMTP Relay Server -> Mailserver -> User

* Outbound
User -> Mailserver -> SPAMBOX -> SMTP Relay Server -> Internet

inbound traffic coming from the Internet is proxied by SPAMBOX
toward the additional local SMTP Relay Server which in turn routes the emails to the
internal mailserver; this also has an advantage; if you have more than
a single "internal" mailserver (e.g. different mailservers for different
domains) such a setup will take care of routing the incoming emails
to the correct mailserver;
outbound traffic is routed by the mailserver(s)
toward the SPAMBOX relay port (which may even be port 25 as long as the
SPAMBOX box has a second address ) and SPAMBOX then proxies such emails
to the SMTP Relay Server for outbound delivery
